It‚Äôs absolutely fucking absurd that Song Kang-Ho did not get any Oscar attention for his role in this film. He gives the most expressive, wide-ranging performance of the year. I mean, the entire ensemble is outstanding (I think I‚Äôve already said how terrific Cho Yeo-jeong‚Äôs comedic performance is) but Song is the emotional center of this film both in its funniest and it‚Äôs most tragic moments.

2019-06-29,5.0,"Holy fucking shit. I can‚Äôt tell if this movie is a masterpiece or if Bong Joon-ho himself is the masterpiece.
The poster for this film quotes David Ehrlich‚Äôs Indiewire review that says this solidifies his movies as a genre of their own, and he‚Äôs totally right.

2019-05-22,4.5,"Bong Joon-ho, the sui generis South Korean auteur behind unclassifiable modern wonders like ‚ÄúBarking Dogs Never Bite‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Host,‚Äù has always made films that refuse to fit the narrow parameters of any particular genre. Each of them is built atop a bedrock of comic violence that Bong uses to support the weight of the heavy stories he places on top of it, but simply categorizing ‚ÄúSnowpiercer‚Äù as science-fiction or ‚ÄúMemories of Murder‚Äù as a mystery would require you to‚Ä¶ more"

2019-08-09,4.0,"Masterfully constructed and thoroughly compelling genre piece (effortlessly transitioning between familial drama, heist movie, satirical farce, subterranean horror) about the perverse and mutating symbiotic relationship of increasingly unequal, transactional class relationships, and who can and can't afford to be oblivious about the severe, violent material/psychic toll of capitalist accumulation.

Inszenatorisch so meisterhaft konzipiert, strukturiert und gefilmt, dass man sich die Finger lecken m√∂chte, gespickt mit ein paar der sch√∂nsten Bildkompositionen, die man dieses Jahr im Kino finden wird, spielt Bong-Joon Ho mit den Genres, als w√§re es ein Kinderspiel. ‚ÄûParasite‚Äú ist packend, perfide, bisweilen absurd komisch, sensibel und bitterb√∂se, erstaunlicherweise sogar oftmals alles gleichzeitig.

Second viewing, no change. One of those movies where I stand back and admire it as a whole, and I recognize its influence, crossover appeal, and commercial success, but I nonetheless am left cold, even distant from its construction. Not inclined to make an extensive argument (my original review still stands), but if I did, I would begin by saying that its propulsive genre inclinations often clash against its loftier social ideas, and the smooth mechanics of the narrative‚Ä¶ more"

Parasite is well written. Funny. Stressful. Thrilling. Intoxicating. Incredible. Terrific. Brilliant.
It's about social discrepancy between the rich and the poor. And yeah the title ""Parasite"" perfectly captures what this movie is all about. Just believe me, the hype is real!! You will laugh your ass off and later you might hold tight to your seat.
And that ending tho!!! I was silent for a moment and like.... Oke... Hhmmm.... Oh my god..... FUCK!!! (high level depression)

2019-10-17,5.0,"""It's so metaphorical.""
Parasite is an operatic, Shakespearean tragedy, and more specifically it is a modern take on the tragedy of the commons‚Äîone that actually critiques the traditional 20th century theory and reinvigorates the idea for contemporary society.
The tragedy of the commons is a concept originally formulated in the 1800‚Äôs to explain phenomena like overgrazing, situations where independent groups acting in their own self-interest in a shared-resource system work incidentally or unconsciously against the common good (e.g. cows that‚Ä¶ more"

It's also a tense, funny, extremely entertaining film that didn't feel its length at all. Go into it without knowing anything if you can; it made my viewing experience all the more exciting.

I‚Äôve watched the peach/blood napkin, flood, and birthday party scenes countless times, and they amaze me with their humor or symbolism. Bong Joon Ho is a mastermind creator.

2019-08-12,4.5,"Labyrinths, and therefore ghosts, manifested by the excessive designs of wealth for the impoverished to lose their bearings within. For them to not only become spatially disoriented by the bottomlessness of the structure's framework, but to become physically adrift to the point of brotherly pitilessness and self-consuming strong-arm tactics. Earnest derision delivered through the device of a ""game"" with no innocent players. Not a judgment but a predicament, as nobody is left without the burden of guilt or foul play in a system designed to oppose man against man for the sake of a cushy, pecuniary illusion of safety."
