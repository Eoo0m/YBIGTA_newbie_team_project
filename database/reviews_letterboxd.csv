‚ÄúThis is so metaphorical!‚Äù
This. This right here. Wow. I don‚Äôt wanna speak too soon, but Parasite might be among the best films of the decade. It‚Äôs the rare mix of accessible mainstream storytelling that anyone can enjoy, accompanied by plenty of subtle and layered filmmaking for fans to dissect in years to come. It might be The Movie We Need Right Now‚Ñ¢, but it‚Äôs also the movie we‚Äôve always needed and the movie we can all engage with.
Parasite exemplifies how sometimes the best way to get Westerners to wake up to the problems in their own culture is to paint the big picture through the lens of a foreign one. If this film had been made by Americans, with the rich family as Beverly Hills divas and the poor family as illegal immigrants or another tired clich√©, we‚Äôd probably be calling the whole thing on-the-nose and heavy-handed; and unproductively, the high-class people indicted by it would be as up-in-arms as a boomer watching the end of Blackkklansman.
But that‚Äôs what seeing a story through the eyes of another culture does: it illuminates the universal human problem at the core while eradicating the touchy political specifics, stereotypes and labels of our own. It allows the viewer to listen without knee-jerking to their preconceived beliefs. Parasite is as much a film about class struggles in Seoul, South Korea as it is about the universal class struggles around the world.
Throughout the film, Bong Joon-Ho masterfully shapes an ever-changing tone, depicting a societal breaking point through a cloudy and disenchanted lens‚Ä¶but he never feels motivated solely by anger or cynicism alone. The real motivator in Parasite, despite the film‚Äôs bleak outcome, is one of empathy.
...
‚ÄúOh, so you have a plan?‚Äù family patriarch Kim Ki-Taek asks his son Ki-Woo optimistically near the beginning of the film. This question is repeated many times throughout the rest of the tale. ‚ÄúHey. Our phones are dead. The WiFi is shutoff. What‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù Kim‚Äôs wife Chung-Sook asks him expectantly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have a plan?!‚Äù a shocked Ki-Taek asks the wiry Geun-sae, who has accepted his place below the ground and stopped trying to climb the social staircase. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I have a plan,‚Äù Ki-Taek assures his son after things go awry and their entire semi-basement home is flooded. Ki-Woo makes a similar assurance at the very end, planning and promising to work his way up in the world and make enough money to free his father from abject poverty.
If you‚Äôre poor, the world always expects you to have a ‚Äúplan‚Äù to get un-poor. That‚Äôs the American dream, isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs why capitalism is the solution to all our problems. Because even if you‚Äôre slumming it in the lowest of the low, if you pour enough hard work and vigor into pulling yourself up, you‚Äôll eventually find success and reach the top. You‚Äôll be home, where you belong, watching rain falling on the lawn and drinking yourself silly.
Pretty weird, though, how in order to eventually become part of the high-class, you‚Äôll have to spend most of your days serving the high-class without any hint of eventual payoff. They might start to treat you kindly. They might share some of their food with you. They might even invite you to a few birthday parties. But in the end, you‚Äôll always be a commodity, working for salvation at the expense of your own life. In the end, they‚Äôll still complain about your smell behind your back, or make up an excuse to fire you because the truth is too embarrassing. And in the end, like Ki-Jung, you‚Äôll realize you were eating dog treats like a house pet all along.
Remember: you can work hard and be personable, but Mr. Park just can‚Äôt tolerate it if you ‚Äúcross the line.‚Äù Mr. Park is a video-game designer. He understands the woes of the working man.
Parasite is about a vicious cycle. The characters don‚Äôt succeed. Though we might like it to be, this is not a successful guide to eating the rich and ruling the world in their place. That‚Äôs not the moral of the story.
For one thing, the rich we‚Äôre ‚Äúeating‚Äù are actually pretty decent people. The Park family is far from overtly evil or sinister, which speaks to Bong Joon-Ho‚Äôs aversion to caricatures and extremes. Indeed, the Parks are perfectly nice, and their cardinal sin is one of obliviousness and blissful naivety. But then, as Chung-Sook remarks, maybe they are only ‚Äúnice because they are rich.‚Äù Their cushion of privilege emboldens them with the luxury of niceness.
For the Parks, everything that occurs will always occur in their favor. It‚Äôs not that they automatically gain whenever the poor lose. It‚Äôs just that whenever something truly negative happens, their wealth turns lemons into lemonade and transforms it into a minor inconvenience ‚Äî or even a straight-up blessing. The rainstorm that flooded the Kims‚Äô entire neighborhood with neck-deep sewage water? Sure, it meant the Parks had to pack up their tent and outdoor projector and come home. But, as Mrs. Park notes, it also cleared up the pollution for an impromptu Sunday-afternoon garden party!
Young son Da-Song sleeps soundly through the storm in a child‚Äôs play tent ordered from the US. Meanwhile, the Kims‚Äô home is irreparably destroyed and they‚Äôre left sleeping on the floor of a gym. This is why the members of the high-class, in all their safety and privilege, find it so hard to care about the effects of climate change. Whatever happens to the rest of the world will affect their lives very little. And as we all know, the poor people who live on the coastlines will all just sell their homes and move to a nicer place. That will totally happen.
In another stroke of luxury, the Parks can also afford to embrace and pursue their personal giftings, and receive help for their shortcomings to remove all possibility of failure. Older daughter Da-Hye might not be good at English, but she can get a tutor to help her. Da-Song, a fanboy at heart, has parents who will endorse and encourage all of his interests, from art projects to Native-American dress-up. Indeed, he‚Äôs immune to the outside world enough to appropriate the culture of an oppressed people for his own fun and games.
Da-Song‚Äôs mundanely juvenile artistic skills are over-rewarded and overanalyzed, while someone like Ki-Jung could never hope to get into an art school even with her knowledge of Photoshop. The expressive, unrepressed and emotionally impulsive nature every person buries deep down is allowed to run wild in Da-Song because of his young age and his family‚Äôs affluence.
Kim family patriarch Ki-Taek has had some of the same animalistic aggression bubbling up inside him for years due to his own destitution, but to set it free or act on it would only harm his prospects even further. Better to put on a happy face and just do what the rich man asks, right? He‚Äôs paying generously, after all.
...

The film‚Äôs penultimate scene features Ki-Taek wearing a Native American headdress for Da-Song‚Äôs party. Mr. Park is wearing one too. But while Park looks almost stylish, comfortable, content in his privilege to be appropriating the imagery of an oppressed culture millions of miles away, Kim looks a little pathetic. In a certain sense, he is the Native American. Minutes later, Ki-Taek will be the one to turn and kill Mr. Park with a kitchen knife. The smell never bothered him, anyway.
Parasite feels like it accepts violence as an inevitability - a result of the boiling water overflowing and attempting to upend the status quo - but it also reinforces the idea that violence is ultimately futile, and may further cement the divide. 
Violently taking down the rich may lead to short-term catharsis, but it‚Äôs a vicious cycle that will place you right back where you started. For all his attempts to work his way up, everything Ki-Taek does ultimately lands him back in the bunker, worshipping his high-class overlord for lack of anything else to do, just like the now-deceased Geun-Se. One wonders how many of Geun-Se‚Äôs other, more violent actions Ki-Taek might be doomed to repeat given enough time.
We side with the Kims for most of the movie‚Ä¶until we don‚Äôt. As they achieve early success and start to get a glimpse at the prosperity waiting for them on the other side, the family becomes more and more hardened and downright cruel. At first it‚Äôs all part of the comedic tone, but then it‚Äôs not. Ki-Woo is emboldened to chase a loiterer away from the family‚Äôs front window ‚Äî and his first choice of weapon is a massive rock. Ki-Jung drunkenly complains that the family should only be worrying about themselves. Chung-Sook pretends to care for the Parks‚Äô dogs and then angrily shoves them away when they‚Äôre not around. Ki-Taek seems the most reserved, until something finally breaks inside him and he becomes the most extreme of all.
Ascending the social staircase (which feels like the best thing to call it, given the imagery) isn‚Äôt a peaceful experience among the poor. The attempts the Kims make to achieve prosperity ultimately drive them toward the notion that they must leave everyone of the ""low-class"" behind to save themselves. It's a notion that was heavily dissected in Jordan Peele's Us earlier this year. Later in the film, the Kims even violently clash with another low-class family to elevate their own status. Fired housekeeper Moon-Gwang begs Chung-Sook for her help as a ‚Äúfellow member of the needy‚Äù - to which Chung-Sook replies ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not needy.‚Äù Later, she haphazardly kills Moon-Gwang as she attempts to maintain appearances with the Parks. There is no peaceful transition to the upper level. You must be as oppressive as your oppressor. Care about no one else.
And yet, even at their worst, it rarely feels like the Kims‚Äô actions are the result of petty selfishness or coldhearted greed. Whether we can endorse them or not, they are always the result of a system that (seemingly) left no alternative path to follow. Ya know, it‚Äôs kinda like the scene in that dancing clown movie where he kills the late-night host, except with a whole lot more depth and moral ambiguity and conflict.

‚Ä¶
I only noticed it on the second viewing, but the film opens and closes on the same shot. Socks are drying on a rack hanging in the semi-basement by the window. The camera pans down to a hopeful Ki-Woo sitting on his bed. In the opening shot, Ki-Woo is searching his phone for a nearby WiFi signal he can mooch from - the first of many attempts to scrounge the table scraps of the wealthy and carry on with his ‚Äúplan.‚Äù In the closing shot, as the camera pans past the snow falling outside, Ki-Woo is back in the same spot, this time writing a wistful letter to his father and promising that this time, the plan will work. How will he even manage to deliver the letter? Will his promises ever be fulfilled? We don‚Äôt know. But despite the dramatic and violent attempts to climb the social staircase we‚Äôve witnessed in the past 2 hours, the boy is back at square-one‚Ä¶with only his mistaken ambition (and two less family members) left to comfort him.
This is around the time when I‚Äôd usually write a closing paragraph about the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù of the movie; I‚Äôd love to talk about the practical takeaway of the story and what we can do to fix the problems it presents. But if the film shows anything, it might be that the ways we usually approach ‚Äúsolving‚Äù poverty and ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the class struggle often just reinforce how things have been since the beginning.
Bong Joon-Ho has mentioned in several interviews that the Parks‚Äô obliviousness to the problems of the have-nots comes mainly from their cushion of economic protection; they‚Äôre so sheltered that they are rarely even made aware of the world below their line. Not only have they rarely experienced true pain, but they've rarely had reason to even observe it elsewhere, either. As such, the Parks would rather stay out of that world altogether than face the experience of riding a dirty subway. I think many of us, including those who belong to the middle-class, probably have a level of self-inflicted ignorance toward the margins, too. When you start to feel empathy for the have-nots, it often demands action, and that's scary. But if Parasite does anything in the lives of the middle and high-class people who see it, I hope it shines a light on those margins, creating empathy and demanding action. Maybe, after watching a film that brings to light the least of these, we can start to meditate on our own privilege and how we can be more compassionate. Maybe we can pop our own bubbles and be more aware of how our blessings can be the curses of others. And maybe someday, if or when the whole system comes crashing down, we can rebuild it with new understanding.

...

All this, and we never even talked about the filmmaking! Gratefully, everything here feels elegant and masterful without ever being showy. There are some long oners here, but they never call attention to themselves. There are some great visual motifs here, but they rarely spoonfeed their meaning. There is some great acting here, but it never feels like ‚Äú‚Äùacting‚Äù‚Äù meant for a showreel at the Oscars. The musical choices are potent, often ironic, and unique. The imagery is strong and crystal clear in its intentions, but the characters always feel real and never on-the-nose. The production design (and overall geography of the key setpiece) is constructed beautifully to allow for the maximum amount of Hitchcockian thrills. And with all those elements stirred together like a nice warm dish of Ram-Don - ""what the hell is ram-don?"" - Bong Joon-Ho has created his masterpiece."
2019-10-11,5.0,"I saw someone on Twitter doing that annoying thing where they sneer at the idea that a movie that people love really could be as good as they say and then asking for more opinions, hoping to find just one person who says something like ""it was fine"" and then latch onto that one take as the definitive proof that there's some sort of conspiracy (?) to declare a film as great when it's actually ""just fine."" It's a very stupid trend that seems like a thinly-veiled way to get ahead of the curve and preemptively shit on a popular movie and cast all of that movie's fans as rabid sheep who can't think for themselves, in order to present as someone having a hot take that makes you seem smarter and more with it than all those ""idiots"" who enjoyed the movie‚Äì but it alllllllways comes across as corny and embarrassingly contrarian.
The closest thing I can find to a kernel of worth in doing that, is the conceit that if you do go into a movie thinking it's not ""as good as everyone says,"" there's a great chance that you'll truly be stunned and let yourself be overwhelmed into an experience far above what you were expecting. Sometimes it feels like there's a psychology to film, where your brain is constantly trying to fight against the preconceived notions it has about a piece of art, like a strange defense mechanism. If everyone's saying it's good, you'll have to overcorrect for that expectation and end up letting yourself down. If it's said to be bad, you're setting yourself at a low bar to be extremely impressed when they do three flips over the thing from a standing position (which is impressive, even without a bar to cross!) And maybe that's what this person was concerned with in this movie.
People are calling this the movie of the year, a masterpiece, talking about how rich the themes and comedy are, how terrific the performances are, how great a director Bong Joon-ho is‚Äì but if you're going into the theater with that all in mind, aren't you erasing the very chance of surprise and wonder from your experience? I'd like to think that's not entirely the case, as this was the second time I'd seen it‚Äì long after the volunteer army for Bong Joon-ho & Sang Kang-ho's Oscars was formed (of which I am a proud cadet)‚Äì and the audience still seemed absolutely enthralled and rapt with the movie they were watching. And so was I! But I don't want to give the sneering contrarian crowd, or the cautious contrarian brain, any ammo by teeing it up in any special way.
All of that said, Parasite fuckin' sucks. Enjoy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Bong Joon-ho's long con. Parasite is representative of both his style and his limitations. What a stellar first act, which moves vertically between semi-basement homes and high-class spaces, tracking the financial gain and life-changing upward trajectory of one family and, most damning, the rich stasis of the other. Never has the visual repetition of a rich businessman trudging home after a loooooong day at work (so sad) been so vicious. Bong's framing allows for the class divide to showcase itself naturally, as with the cutaway to Yeon-kyo watching Ki-woo tutor Ki-jung: the rich observing if the service satisfies her metric, which isn't about whether she's learning, but the pursuit of power and utilizing it productively. Checking her pulse rather than her answers. While the Kim family can't seem to do anything wrong, Bong reveals an effortless yet *constant* performative interplay between what they do to maintain survival and the non-effort of the Park family.
This riveting surface-level dynamic *about* surfaces, and who can afford to openly display their desires and privilege, their hatred and distance, collapses when Bong decides to reveal a subterranean layer to the scenario. While a shocking narrative development, and one which springboards the film towards its tense, queasy third-act, full of sharp formal tricks and detours into physical comedy and horror, Bong loses his way in the exploration of what the Park family isn't aware of. Parasite ultimately slips his hand against the edge he's been sharpening, and it concludes as a film that tortures its low-class protagonists while not utilizing that collateral damage as fuel to accurately explore the scum of the rich.
For instance: the entrance lights. 'The Park family assuming a motion-sensor feature and yet it's all under the control of a poor man living unknowingly in their secret nuclear bunker' is a doozy of a indictment, but it doesn't go far enough. Bong not confronting the fact that the uber-rich are very much aware of their treatment and knowledge of exploiting workers and labor for an effortless lifestyle is a key component that weakens his anger. Sure, the trite cliches of 'poor people smell bad' are there, as is the ""we're paying you overtime, so think of it as part of your work"" zinger that thrusts the vengeance of the climax into gear, but none of that combats Bong's disregard for the insidious agency of the Park family. There's no rhyme or reason to building up the 'all-or-nothing' desperation of the Kim family only to not indict the family they're working for. ""Every house has a bunker like this."" - well, duh! Thank you for the reminder. Going back to the broader picture of systemic class divides after setting the dominoes for a critical exposure of their culpability is just plain toothless! Jordan Peele's Us has less slack for the upper-class than this movie!
Anyways, in spite of all that, Parasite still won me over. It moves so well, and skirts a fine line between being ludicrous and outlandish without teetering into either corner. The camping scene is one such example, with the class barriers designed and set into motion with the utmost intent. What I wish Bong Joon-Ho would go back to, as in the case of Mother and Memories of Murder, is to acutely damn the object under the microscope, rather than simply letting us know it exists. There's no reason not to send them down to the basement. They know they're there."

2020-04-08,5.0,"Capitalism is more insidious now than it ever was. There used to be a simple dynamic: merchants, manufacturers, and landowners exploited labourers to create profit. Inequality was obvious. But now, in an era of service sector dominance, liberalism as elitism, and class prefaced as theoretical, lines are blurred. Who are the exploited? *silence* Obviously, still the workers. But capitalism has convinced half the world that the rich suffer. Parasite is a Rorschach test. Some see only the base analogy and go ""who is the real parasite?"". Please don't be that person. Capitalism is inherently parasitic, not because rich and poor equally exploit each other, but because the rich exploit the poor and the poor also exploit the poor. This is the central thesis of Parasite, which is why it comes down to two working class families fighting each other, and the rich just allowing it through indifference. No longer are the rich just evil mill owners watching as poor people die in the street, they are now nice people like me and you, who just don't like to hear about bad things so do nothing as millions suffer in poverty. Same end result, just marketed better. If you can't understand why Ki-taek stabs Mr Park, you're proof that a century of capitalism has convinced us not to fight for change. Parasite is the perfect analogy for the friendly face of exploitation we now accept as reasonable. Please leave us to die, all we want is to dream of having a house as nice as yours. We won't fight Mr Park, in fact, we respect you for everything. Now let us give this film some awards so we won't feel bad for ignoring the message.

Second viewing, up from 63. The finale's not as misguided as I'd thought, even if I still firmly believe that Bong undercuts his primary, razor-sharp theme by having Dad stab Mr. Park. To be sure, that slow burn is quite strong‚Äîthere's something singularly humiliating about overhearing others sneer at your eau de poverty, and it's entirely plausible that seeing Mr. Park wrinkle his nose in disgust at that moment would make Ki-taek snap. Were Parasite's class-war conflict more conventional‚Äîsimply rich vs. poor‚ÄîI'd have no qualms. But the genius of the film's left-field twist is the way that it pits one underprivileged family against another, echoing the pointless jockeying for crumbs (as opposed to, say, seizing power from the entitled minority) that permeates the entire capitalist world. Parasite draws the most blood if the Park family emerges entirely unscathed; Bong's actual ending (including the whole Morse code thing, which is overly contrived for my taste) muddles the implicit message (per Sin√©ad O'Connor): ""Fight the real enemy."" There's plenty of poor-on-poor violence at that party, though, and a second viewing really brought home the film's gift for staying vertical. Even when the Parks get low to the ground, fooling around while reclining on their couch, the Kim family can be found lower still."

2023-08-17,5.0,"Perhaps the greatest aspect of this masterpiece, aside from the immense writing, symbolism, performances and gripping plot, is Joon-ho‚Äôs visual storytelling. Little details like when the family rushes back to their household during the flood, and the camera pans out to show the family descending down flights of stairs. Or the end shot of the camera transitioning from the window downwards, symbolizing us going back to their reality. Showing how near impossible it is to escape the system constantly dragging you down.

2022-06-07,5.0,and its gonna do it for me every time
2020-01-04,5.0,"Joon Ho‚Äôs genius mixture of genres comes from an ancient line of very specific auteurs. The most relevant name that came to my mind is Youssef Chahine, in particular Cairo Station (1958), where the treatment of genres followed a similar pacing and structure until culminating with one of the most spectacular effects of cognitive dissonance ever displayed in celluloid, and the genre shifting is activated with a plot point. This essay constitutes a social satire through dark comedy eyes about marginalization of social classes, social status discrimination and one of the most toxic ideas that has predominated in the highest spheres of power and superficial ideologies: that balance is restored through violence.
The now internationally famous South Korean director steps away from national politics and demystifies a societal axiom: no socioeconomic class possesses a higher moral than the other. Both life levels are ridiculed through satirical eyes without diminishing the struggle of the lower class in capitalist societies. The gargantuan entertainment value never sacrifices the thematic subtext of this carefully crafted essay, and the great majority of performances are quite exceptional. My only minor complaint is that the target rich family is too credible and unsuspecting for fueling what Ho‚Äôs script has stored beneath its magical sleeve; nevertheless, the events unleashed are of great surprise and, while you‚Äôre smiling at the comedic success of scumbags, it is inevitable to feel a strong, thriller-derived heart-pounding even before the thriller genre is officially introduced through one unusual stunt that only Asian cinema could bring along.
The low-class struggle is a theme that has been pervasively treated cinematically even much before Neorealism; thanks to Lumi√®re, we noticed that human exploitation was quite present among women much more than we would think nowadays. With more modern deliveries, the imperialist philosophy of ruling over goods and territory through the acquisition of power is each time more present in cynical films, including developing countries. However, the extreme opposite is also debated and suggested. This film constantly brought Luis Estrada‚Äôs films to mind. When he goes political, his commentaries are quite assertive, such as in La Ley de Herodes (1999), but when Un Mundo Maravilloso (2006) came out in national theaters, I remember attending at the age of 16 and leaving the cinema enraged at the ending under the excuse of ‚Äúblack comedy‚Äù, because the ending was poisonous and contradictory to no end. Joon Ho is careful enough to leave the concept of justice as relative as it actually is, while playing with wonderful camerawork throughout in order to suggest the preconceptions we should have before and during each scene and then destroying them with surprises.
So far, it seems like nothing will dethrone Memories of Murder (2003) as my precious Joon Ho masterpiece, simply because, in spite of being primordially a thriller, it explores human psychology and impulsive motivation more acutely. That is not the particular focus of Parasite; it all just comes down to what we consider more relevant to our artistic sensibilities. Even so, this has become one of the few successful cases in recent world cinema that has united both international masses and arthouse critics alike in agreement (if they could be separated as such, because they can‚Äôt), such as Pulp Fiction (1994) and The Pianist (2002). Maybe it's because of our consciousness: Who is the real parasite? The question is not answered with the social strata filter.

2019-11-10T18:17:52.014Z,4.0,"so right after graduating a v snooty college, i was homeless for two months. i had some promising job interviews but nothing lined up yet, and one of my friends was gonna let me move in with her once she got her current roommate situation sorted out, but that wouldn‚Äôt be until September. so i was in full couch surfing panic mode
but i did have one resource at my disposal. during college i'd dated the daughter of a bigshot executive at some legacy news outlets, and eventually gotten to meet the big guy himself. he took a liking to me and would invite me to dinner every time we were in the same city, treating me like the fascinating subject of his new biography even though i was just some dumb Polack from a blue collar Chicago family
and like... you know rich people. they have more than they could ever possibly need, and they love to think they‚Äôre kind and generous
so i told him about my plight and he was like well that just doesn't make sense. you're smart and urbane and charming, so it just won't do to have you checking into shelters and hostels every night. and for most of that period before I could move in to a permanent address, he offered to let me stay in his pied a terre on Central Park West
occasionally i had to clear out and erase all presence of my existence because he'd tell me that someone rich was coming to stay there for a night or two. (i‚Äômma note here that the pied a terre had several bedrooms and could have easily fit me plus his other guests) but i still got to live, for the most part, this charmed life in this lavish building in one of the most expensive neighborhoods IN THE WORLD and befriending the really hot doormen. hell yah
and i remember one time i got in an elevator and there was this older guy who saw what floor i was going to and was like, oh, floor 8, that's the big journalism man. and he asked me, are you the son?
and every part of me just wanted to say yes. yes i am the son. this man that you're obsessed with enough to know what floor his apartment is on, i'm his son. this man that you know little enough about personally that you don‚Äôt realize that he doesn‚Äôt have any sons lmao, i‚Äôm his son. this man that you clearly see as an important cultural gatekeeper, i'm his son
i'm the one that can get you access to him. you want to write some hack fuckin article about your business in his weekly magazine? talk to me. i can make that happen. you want to be on a cable news panel so you can brag to your shitty dinner party goblin friends about it? beg me for that
i ended up not saying any of that because it seemed... profoundly risky. and because this story is kinda about me being a coward
but i wanted to say it so bad. i wanted to be the one with the power, the one with the access, the one that could be impressed, the one that HAD to be impressed. i saw how fucking ugly this guy was, prostrating himself over the journalism man‚Äôs glory in a golden elevator, and i hated him for it. i hated him for the same ugliness i'd covered myself in so many times. lying in bed and practicing all my dinner party anecdotes that could make rich people fall in love with me enough to extent me ephemeral scraps of charity
did you know that the Roman emperor Caligula was a lot less mad and incompetent than history remembers him as? is what i'd ask them. that was a favorite story of mine. It‚Äôs a wild oversimplification of the history, but it‚Äôs true enough and which one of these empty-headed dorks was gonna call me out on it
did you know that the famous story of him trying to give a Consulship to his horse Incitatus was actually a symbolic gesture on his part to show his contempt for the patrician class? a fuckin horse could do your job better, he was telling them. and the Romans loved rewriting their history to talk shit about whoever had just forcefully tumbled out of the seat of power, so they damned his memory and said everything he did was incoherent clown shit
did you know that the common people loved Caligula, by and large, through much of his reign? he offered them a generous grain dole and lavish public works and rousing games... which he funded by executing patricians on trumped up charges and seizing their assets. Isn‚Äôt that wild, that this guy who‚Äôs synonymous with hedonistic madness might‚Äôve been more of a ruthless, canny populist leader than we give him credit for. isn‚Äôt that a smart and charming and urbane story you just listened to
they loved that anecdote so much. enough of them confirmed it to me directly that i can guarantee you they repeated it time and time again in the company of their high society friends. and i can guarantee you that all they internalized from it was ""this friend of mine, this very charming and sophisticated young man who's a scholar of ancient Roman history, told me this fascinating story about an emperor. the secret is‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs NOT what you might remember from school!""
i can guarantee you none of them internalized what i was actually telling them, which was, ""holy shit dude i'd like to kill you‚Äù"

There are moments that have your heart racing as fast as lightning but then 2 minutes they‚Äôll be a scene where you can‚Äôt help laugh.‚Ä¶ more"

2021-04-01,0.5,"I can‚Äôt believe I ever liked this movie, what was I thinking?
Overacted, lack of diversity in the cast, and there were no standout performances. 
The plot jumps all over the place from one genre to the next, and there are so many plot holes?  Would anyone ever really be living under someone‚Äôs house? That‚Äôs just blatantly unrealistic. It preaches these themes of class struggles and self-worth but is just an over-inflated ego boost for Bong Joon-ho.
Not looking forward to whatever projects anyone involved in this movie has next, a hard 1/2 star for Parasite.

One of the best films of the year.
I didn't know anything about this film except the title and the director's name, that's the reason I enjoyed every bit of it. Another great work by Bong Joon-Ho

Hilarious, heartbreaking and edge of the seat suspenseful 2hrs 12minutes, with very good cast, brilliant direction and beautiful cinematography. The film starts with comedy and as it moves forward it changes it's genre.
Believe all the hype and watch it (It's better to watch without knowing anything about it.)

2023-05-05,4.5,"In Parasite, many scenes are characterized by the presence of stairs going up and down: from those of the splendid villa of the rich Park family, to the incredibly long stairways that surround the city of Seoul, and which lead up to the squalid and smelly neighborhood where the proletarian Kims live. Bong Joon-ho's film is the story of a social opposition and the difficulties that people belonging to the lower classes have to face in trying to improve their condition. Often, in fact, those who find themselves at the bottom of the ""ladder"" desperately try to move up the the steps of society, so as to redeem the misery of their original situation. Nevertheless, those with great wealth and a high social position tend to neglect the reality of the weaker sections of the population and such disregard comes at a cost. The South Korean director weaves these themes together in an ironic and grotesque introduction, which however later gives way to more dramatic and disturbing tones. The shift in register is unsettling, but inserted in a very natural way into the narrative, thanks to a masterful writing and direction, and to the perfect performances by an ensemble cast.

While this film is Korean, it deals with issues of class so universally understood that it fully seems to transcend language and cultural barriers. Bong has always been a strong film maker but I truly believe this is his masterpiece and I'm so happy the film is seeing the recognition it deserves.

Huge S/O to a friend (on Patreon) for hooking me up with a screener for this film. I wanted to see it so bad when I started to see the buzz but knew there was nothing I could do; thankfully, he swooped into my DM‚Äôs and gave me the chance to witness something that I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about since the second it ended. There is so much to soak in with this film and, still, much more to unpack. Joon Ho Bong is a obviously a talented director but he has never been one to live up to the hype (for me) until now.
Parasite is clearly his best work and it‚Äôs an experience that tackles almost every element of what makes a movie great. Since it has yet to be released and it‚Äôs such a surprising experience; I don‚Äôt want to get into what works so well about the plot. Upon rewatch (after release) I will return with a full spoiler review because it‚Äôs a movie that requires this. I will say that while the first few scenes were well-crafted; I was wondering what all of the hype was about. It‚Äôs a film that looks at division of class and begins with a poor family who is just trying to do whatever they can to ‚Äúmake it.‚Äù
We‚Äôre already conflicted as an audience because we feel sorrow; yet we know what they are doing here is wrong (or at least how they are going about it). Once they begin to infiltrate this rich family‚Äôs home, the madness begins. It goes from interesting, to engaging, to intriguing, to pure ‚Äúedge of your seat‚Äù thrilling. As soon as, what I will refer to as, ‚Äúthe event‚Äù happened; I sat back and found an entirely new appreciation for what this movie was doing. It somehow juggles all of these elements that could have easily compromised the story.
I would normally critique a film like this and say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs just too much;‚Äù but I always preach the fact that it is all about the execution. If all of these plot points are executed properly, a movie can easily get away with them. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of almost everything with Parasite. Tone, pacing, character depth, narrative structure, intensity, and so many more elements are all handled to perfection. The family dynamic is interesting enough but when they begin to mix with this upper class family; the story begins to reveal itself.
I normally don‚Äôt praise films for trying to shoehorn in social commentary but it‚Äôs the opposite case here. The social commentary almost eclipses the story and it sends a powerful message to everyone. The way that it handles the politics of class, but manages to inject this sense of dark humor, is almost the perfect balance. Just when you think you realize what you‚Äôre in for, the film shifts and continues to showcase the best of ‚Äúwhat cinema should be‚Äù until the final frame. The ending had me worried for a second but it was captivating. Overall, Parasite may not end up being my favorite movie of 2019 but it should be in the discussion for the the best movie of 2019. It hasn‚Äôt left my brain since.

Disclaimer: Snowpiercer improved significantly for me on second viewing, leaping from roughly the same ""pretty good"" rating to a near-miss for my top 10 list. (It's still #11.) Don't anticipate that happening with Parasite, though, mostly because Bong grounds this tale of class warfare more firmly in the real world, even as the tone remains antic verging on absurdist.

I am in awe of what Bong Joon-ho has accomplished with Parasite. After two subpar films (that‚Äôs right, I didn‚Äôt really enjoy Snowpiercer nor Okja), I feared Bong had lost his mojo, especially after three fantastic South Korean films.
Parasite removes all doubt and makes me ashamed I doubted Bong for a moment. The praise and the hype might seem like hyperbole, but I assure you they are not.

2025-01-24,4.5,"Parasite took the cinematic world by storm back in 2019, arguably the centerpiece of the best year in film in recent times. Every review website you can imagine went crazy for this film from IMDb to Letterboxd. It introduced much of the world to Korean New Wave cinema, leading audiences to directors like Bong Joon-ho and Park Chan-wook. It won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and became the first foreign language film to win Best Picture.
Rewatching this film, I noticed several details I hadn't noticed before. For example, towards the end, Ki-woo awakens to see a detective and a doctor who don't resemble their respective roles. This implies that the Kims aren't the only improvised people engaging in the impersonation con game. This does lend to a theme in the film, where the lower classes fight for scraps from the upper class. I also noticed the amount of English loanwords and codeswitching used; I can't imagine what Korean would sound like 1000 years from now. However, I did notice some translation inconsistencies (ex: Chapaguri being localized as 'Ramdon').
As for the film itself, Bong Joon-ho directs with a sublime quality and a Gesamtkunstwerk ethos. The story flows so naturally and is intricately plotted. The cinematography provides beautiful shots that often serve a symbolic purpose (the staircase down to the lower levels). Even the set design lends character to the Parks' mansion. The film starts as a black comedy where a poor family exploits the naivety of a rich family and integrates themselves into their lives. But then at the halfway point, the film makes a sharp turn toward a thriller with more serious social commentary. The two halves are starkly different, and yet the transition feels so natural and keeps the story exciting.
Much has been said about themes relating to class conflict. While you can interpret the film as a fable on late-stage capitalism, I see the film from a different angle. I'm sure many of you have heard the recent news surrounding the coup attempt in South Korea. Reading deeper into it, I realized that South Korean politics are fucked up as a whole. With this context, media like Parasite and Squid Game suddenly make sense. It reminds me of Blue Velvet where the glitzy surface of South Korea is covering up the serious societal ills. In other words, Bong Joon-ho is confronting audiences with the hidden troubles of his nation.
I don't think my opinions have improved to the levels of unconditional love. I still have mixed feelings over the ending as it doesn't really stick to the landing. But Parasite is still an incredible film that continues to impress me each time I watch it."

Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family live in a basement flat in Seoul, working low-income jobs and struggling to make ends meet, oftentimes resorting to charm, lies and cheating. When son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) manages to get a job tutoring the daughter of the rich Park family, the Kims scheme to all get jobs with the Parks under assumed names, pretending not to be related to each other ...
Í∏∞ÏÉùÏ∂© (Gisaengchung - ""Parasite"") is a black comedy thriller film co-written and directed by Bong Joon-ho. It won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Best International Feature Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay).
Actually, Bong's movie won countless awards, among them the Palme d'Or at Cannes, became the first film not in the English language to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time.
After two international productions filmed primarily in English, Bong returned to making a fully Korean film with Í∏∞ÏÉùÏ∂©. The movie originated as a play he had written, and once again deals with themes of class and inequality.
While objectively, it's not easy to find a sympathetic character in the film, it's undeniably delightful to watch the Kim family charm, cheat and manipulate their way into the Park household. Once again, Bong blends genres, and while Í∏∞ÏÉùÏ∂© is foremost a black comedy, it also has elements of thriller and drama. It's full of satirical observations, ironic revelations, and increasingly darker twists and turns.
The actors are brillant, each and everyone of them delivering outstanding performances, and the cast features a couple of Bong's frequent collaborators, especially Song Kang-ho in his fourth collaboration with Bong.
The script is flawless, smart and witty, while the cinematography is excellent, the film score wonderful, and the Oscar-nominated art direction outstanding.
Remarkably, the Park's beautifully designed house - just as important a character as the Kims and Parks - isn't an actual building, not even the exterior. It was constructed on a backlot and expanded beyond the garden and first floor with VFX whenever necessary.
In conclusion, Í∏∞ÏÉùÏ∂© is a flawless movie, a masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho, his strongest and most quintessential work to date, a brillant, funny, tragic, smart and highly entertaining black comedy-thriller with an outstanding cast.
This film is on my list of All-time Favorite Movies, and I added it to my Liked Films - the movies I enjoy the most, regardless of their rating.

Bong Joon-ho's films"
2019-10-29,5.0,"wow... what a movie. gorgeously shot, amazing score, incredible script, acting, & direction. Bong Joon-ho is clearly in complete/masterful control of his craft. 

the more i think about how earnestly & uniquely Joon-ho explored the wealth gap, the more im in awe. i keep thinking about a specific moment where the main characters have a fleeting taste of a life they yearn & have infiltrated. its no coincidence the entire movie pivots on this scene. the wealth gap is less like the wealthy family‚Äôs living room glass wall & more like the infinitely steep, concrete covered, gutter filled hill that seperates the two homes."
2019-10-22,2.5,"Formally this is certainly accomplished. It makes great use of its spaces, particularly the elegantly minimalistic home that the poor family scurry around in. The choreography in these sequences is a dizzying flurry of activity, both lithe and blunt (a body is noiselessly kicked at the top of the stairs but lands with a sickening crunch below). But these images are so rigidly contrived to conform to the film‚Äôs message that they don‚Äôt ever feel revelatory, they feel hollow. 
For a thriller, the film has no instinct for mystery. It only seems like an intelligent film because it assumes its audience is fucking stupid and leaves no plot point or thematic detail unexplained. 
While it‚Äôs often entertaining, I couldn‚Äôt pin down its tone; it‚Äôs far too sentimental to be nihilistic, too rigid to be sympathetic, and too calculated to embrace its ample potential for chaos.
And as a political film, it‚Äôs pretty conservative in its aims, using its finely tuned mechanism to make the almost benign point that... rich people are indifferent to the suffering of the poor, that the comfort of wealth is possible because of the exploitation of the working class.
It‚Äôs not a bad message, but it‚Äôs probably a bad sign when your biting social satire is glowingly received by the bourgeois critic class. Say what you want about Joker, at least its vision of class conflict pissed some people off."

Bong's use of landscape, architecture, and space is simply arresting. My favorite Palme D'or winner since Blue is the Warmest Color. Feels like an instant classic that stands all on it's own. Destined to age well, and be loved by many. Likely the first sure thing to win an Oscar I've come across. I can't think of another foreign film on my radar that's likely to come close. We should probably include him more often when we talk about the best directors of this era, ie. Fincher, Nolan, Anderson(both), del Toro, etc. Can't wait to rewatch."

2025-07-06,4.5,"A humbling glimpse into the many parallels and contrasts between easy-living and a systemic desperation. The wealthy play in the rain ‚Äî watching it fall with a calmness ‚Äî while the low class fights to stay afloat in the flooded slums that seem to swallow all kinds of sewage. All the excess waste of the high (literally) class washes down on the undeserving low seated class. Lights flicker as a service, a sign of gratitude to this rich Park family ‚Äî but the struggling Kim family cannot sustain electricity, so the lights flicker weakly. So they hide, they feed and leech off of the Park's: becoming parasites that serve to not overthrow the family, but to take what they need.
Bong Joon Ho takes so many literal metaphors and symbolism in this perfectly acclaimed film. The common trope that the poor, struggling class holds up the foundations of the rich ‚Äî never noticed, nor appraised. Social class is the pathway down a narrow and rocky path, luxury is taken for granted ‚Äî people are depersonalized ‚Äî and the depersonalized transform into lesser-monsters ‚Äî brought to the edge of a cliff, forced to either jump or stay dangling."

Disclaimer: Snowpiercer improved significantly for me on second viewing, leaping from roughly the same ""pretty good"" rating to a near-miss for my top 10 list. (It's still #11.) Don't anticipate that happening with Parasite, though, mostly because Bong grounds this tale of class warfare more firmly in the real world, even as the tone remains antic verging on absurdist. It makes a difference: Plausibility seems irrelevant in the face of aggressively tiered train compartments and a way-over-the-top Tilda Swinton,‚Ä¶ more"

I am in awe of what Bong Joon-ho has accomplished with Parasite. After two subpar films (that‚Äôs right, I didn‚Äôt really enjoy Snowpiercer nor Okja), I feared Bong had lost his mojo, especially after three fantastic South Korean films.

Gisaengchung (Parasite) is director Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs first fully Korean feature since Mother in 2009 and stands as the first Korean film to win the grand prize at Cannes for the Palme d‚ÄôOr in the history of the competition. In Parasite Bong continues his trend of cinematic masterpieces and is yet to disappoint. His latest takes him down a gritty rabbit hole of greed and morally ambiguous quota. The shocks are electric and the comedy is palpable. The climax nothing short of mesmerising with a firm intoxciating punch.

2019-10-13,5.0,"""Parasite"" has once again wormed its way under my skin and clawed into every part of me with its sharp teeth leeching and sucking every last drop of blood. We follow the Kims, an impoverished family bred on soot, dirt and acrid subterranean odor as they live in a dingy dilapidated semi-basement apartment where the sunlight only manages to leak in through their tiny window placed near the ceiling. One day, when the opportunity comes knocking at their door ‚Äì‚Ä¶"
2020-02-08,5.0,"Given the justifiable hype that has followed Bong Joon-Ho's coruscating social satire, I managed to avoid knowing too much about it, just the bare bones: a poor family infiltrates a rich one and things get dark. Going in, you probably think you know what exactly what the title alludes to and you wouldn't be wrong exactly, but it's a smarter and more opaque film than that. Unlike a lot of releases from 2019 - the year of societal cannibalism - it's not a straightforward story of the poor eating the rich. It cuts both ways: the Parks are representative of a parasitical strain at the top of the pile, exploiting economic division to maintain their privilege, as much as Kim's family are emblematic of rapacious bottom feeders. Bong has the whole stinking system in his sights.
I've been a fan since Memories of Murder and it's good to see him getting international recognition now - and unusual for a foreign language film of real sophistication to get such a wide release, from the art house to the multiplex. What I've always liked about Bong is his lightness of touch as a writer and director; he thrives on moral ambiguity and respects his audience's intelligence - he presents you with multi-faceted characters and an unwieldy set of circumstances and says 'you figure it out, I'm not telling you what to think'. Much like Memories, Parasite achieves a lovely tonal balance - instead of moving from one mode to another, with a potentially jarring shift of gears, it never loses sight of the humour, even when the shit really hits the fan. It's a consistently funny film. The delicate tonal balancing act in the script is complimented by the score, which is sometimes upbeat when the action unfolding on screen tells us it should be otherwise and similarly, all low-end ominous strings that presage an underlying darkness when nothing too sinister seems to be going on. Both seem organic.
Balance is a key quality of the visuals too; compositional balance, and a refined colour palette, which emphasizes muted greys and greens, is occasionally shot through with a vibrant burst of colour. One simple tableau that will stay with me is an external shot of the Parks' residence, with Kim's family lounging on the lawn in the foreground, behind them the monochrome angularity of the modernist dream house lit by an otherworldly orange glow, above them a churning sky of blues and grey. There's magic in the composition of the fallout from the garden party too: the tumbling aerial shots tracking the deluge of water over the steps onto the street below, a jungle of cables framing spitting rain and lens flares. High and low is the predominant theme and it's echoed visually in the location of the Parks' house atop a hill, with myriad steps leading up to it, down to the squalid sub-basement Kim's family calls home.
That 'subway smell' is another subtle invocation of this spatial dichotomy and another instance of demonizing the low. What Park is really talking about is the smell of privation. For him, pinpointing the nature of an unpleasant smell is nothing more than a curiosity, but for Kim, who understands the implication of the observation even if Park doesn't, it cuts to the quick. You might not condone his actions but Bong gives you the context to understand them. The Parks aren't entirely unsympathetic though; they aren't monsters, just privileged and oblivious. The fact we see the story unfold through the eyes of the invaders means our allegiance is broadly with them to the end but it's never clear-cut.
She often comes over as a cossetted princess, but Jo Yeo-jeong still invests her character with a certain wide-eyed likability. Lee Sun-kyun's Park can be engagingly down-to-earth at times too, despite his prevalent detachment from reality. On the flip side, as relatable as Kim's wife, son and daughter are they all possess a streak of cruelty that's less easy to swallow. Memorable, nuanced performances across the board, even in the supporting roles. But this is Song Kang-ho's film. He plays the role of downtrodden family man taking a stand to perfection and you bear witness to his reactions to the hands fate deals him - his highs and lows, blind fury and self-reflection. Powerful performance.
In many ways, the Parks have got it coming and there's an undeniable satisfaction in seeing them get it, watching them being taken in by the ingenuity of the con one knife-twist at a time; it's cathartic. There're similarities to Joseph Losey and Harold Pinter's excellent 1963 film The Servant in that respect; many differences as well, but a core idea unites them - that the myopia of the elite invites their own demise. While those at the top rarely look down with any clarity, those at the bottom see every rung of the ladder on the way up."

2025-03-12,5.0,"Bong Joon-ho tells the dynamics of class struggle and the inequalities of modern society through brilliant ideas of script and staging, ""Parasite"" is an extraordinary work that combines comedy and drama in a parable of rising tension
Since the opening, the film shows with practical clarity the enormous social differences between the two families involved, the Kim family forced to live in a dirty basement while the Park family in a majestic architectural masterpiece. This social crack, which becomes more and more evident with the progressive sneaky insertion of the Kim family in the life of the Park‚Äôs one, reveals all its depth, the ""crumbs"" of some represent the extreme wealth of others. 
Bong Joon-ho presents his characters by erasing all stereotypes, no simplistic division between rich as bad people and poor as good. Exploiting this human and social complexity, the South Korean director shows us the Kim family in all its cynicism, willing to do anything to improve their condition, including crushing disadvantaged people as much as they or more. In this ruthless system of class struggle, where there is always someone lower, the disadvantaged who should help each other end up fighting among themselves, as in this case for the ""leftovers"" of those who are in the highest positions
The concept of the parasite becomes in this way applicable on different levels, in a general mechanism each of the characters has the ""merit"" to be addressed as such. The Kim family invade the space of the Park‚Äôs one taking advantage of their wealth and ingenuity, their presence in the luxurious house is often represented in analogy to that of cockroaches, a concept that can of course also be extended to the other mysterious intruders who in turn represent parasites, for both Kim and Park.
On the other hand, the Park family shows contempt for those who are poorer (disgusting but powerfully comprehensive in this sense the issue of the smell), hiding behind a fake friendly appearance the only interest to exploit the services of the Kim family and others like them. In this way they can also be considered as parasites, their wealth becomes the means to exploit others and increase their own well-being, without considering them equals as human beings but rather as mere instruments (as further testimony to the brutality with which they lay off previous workers)
The ending leaves room for different reflections, Ki-taek is destined to prison but makes a choice that contains a great meaning, the man prefers a secret life of total isolation, metaphorical prison of class struggle, rather than the physical prison of law and society, mainly responsible for the mechanism that condemned him. 
Ki-woo, free and alive, seems to have not yet learned his lesson. Through a letter, the young man swears to build his own future with the aim of being able to afford that house theater of events and prison of his father, still chasing the impossible idea of a kind of American dream.
This theme is also keenly explored, thanks to several dialogues (especially in the rich environment) the director repeatedly shows how his country looks at America as a kind of paradise, where everything is always better and beautiful, unable to recognize in it the same problems suffered in the rest of the world
From a technical point of view the film is obviously extraordinary, cinematography and direction are of the highest level as well as the actors (my heart belongs to Song Kang-ho), all impeccable in their respective roles.
Bong Joon-ho skillfully shifts the tones of his work from one genre to another, he manages to immediately engage the viewer through a funny and sharply ironic introduction, dragging it progressively into a story that turns out to be more dark than it seemed to be at the beginning
‚ÄúParasite"" is a film that shines with the ideas of its magnificent director, able to generate different thoughts that remain stuck in mind. The release of his new work, which I hope to watch soon, was a good excuse to enjoy this once again"

RESPECT!!!!!"
2019-08-10,3.0,feelin peachy
2025-02-03,5.0,"This movie rocks.
When Parasite first came out, I thought I was ahead of the curve for loving it immediately. I felt so cool recommending it to everyone I knew, and the best part? Everyone who took my advice came back to thank me. It wasn‚Äôt just a good movie‚Äîit was a cinematic revelation, a film that instantly cemented itself as a modern masterpiece.
What makes Parasite so remarkable is its near-flawless construction. The pacing is impeccable, moving with a deliberate rhythm that keeps you completely engaged, whether it‚Äôs building tension or delivering sharp, unexpected humor. Bong Joon-ho masterfully weaves together genres‚Äîdark comedy, thriller, and social satire‚Äîso seamlessly that the shifts feel natural rather than jarring. There‚Äôs an energy to his filmmaking that makes his work both wildly entertaining and deeply unsettling.
Parasite delivers a biting commentary on class struggle, but what makes it so powerful is how organically that message is embedded in the narrative. It never feels heavy-handed or preachy; instead, it unfolds naturally, revealing layer after layer of economic disparity, desperation, and moral ambiguity. The film never points fingers in a simplistic way‚Äîevery character is complex, flawed, and deeply human. That‚Äôs what makes it so haunting.
Bong Joon-ho has a signature style that balances accessibility with strangeness, mainstream appeal with deeply idiosyncratic storytelling. Parasite exemplifies that perfectly‚Äîit‚Äôs gripping and universally relatable, yet filled with the kind of weird, unexpected flourishes that make his films so uniquely thrilling. The tonal shifts shouldn‚Äôt work, but somehow, they do. One moment, you‚Äôre laughing at the absurdity of the Kim family‚Äôs schemes; the next, you‚Äôre gripping your seat as everything spirals into chaos.
I love this movie. Every time I watch it, I find something new to admire‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the intricacy of the script, the precision of the cinematography, or the sheer brilliance of the ensemble cast. There‚Äôs a reason it became a global phenomenon and made history at the Oscars. It‚Äôs just that good.

2024-05-24,5.0,"Caracas... que filme √© esse? Eu sempre achei que todo o elogio em torno de ""Parasita"" fosse um pouco exagerado, mas estou mais do que feliz por estar errado. Esse filme √© absolutamente maravilhoso, e me sinto compelido a compartilhar minha experi√™ncia com ele.
Desde o in√≠cio, ""Parasita"" me prendeu com seu roteiro extraordin√°rio. √â raro encontrar uma narrativa t√£o bem constru√≠da que consiga transitar de maneira fluida por tr√™s g√™neros diferentes ao longo de seus tr√™s atos: drama, com√©dia e suspense. O que √© mais impressionante √© que o filme n√£o mistura esses g√™neros de maneira ca√≥tica; ao contr√°rio, ele os aborda sequencialmente, sem nunca perder o fio da meada. Cada mudan√ßa de tom n√£o s√≥ √© bem executada, mas tamb√©m enriquece a hist√≥ria, mantendo o espectador engajado a cada minuto.
As atua√ß√µes s√£o simplesmente √©picas. Cada membro do elenco entrega uma performance memor√°vel, trazendo profundidade e autenticidade a seus personagens. Song Kang-ho, como o patriarca Kim Ki-taek, √© especialmente not√°vel. Sua capacidade de transmitir emo√ß√µes complexas com uma sutileza incr√≠vel √© de tirar o f√¥lego. Mas n√£o √© s√≥ ele; todo o elenco est√° em sintonia perfeita, contribuindo para a for√ßa do filme.
E a dire√ß√£o de Bong Joon-ho... que trabalho lindo. A maneira como ele usa a c√¢mera para contar a hist√≥ria √© magistral. A cinematografia √© deslumbrante, com enquadramentos que dizem tanto quanto os di√°logos. Cada cena √© meticulosamente planejada, e isso transparece na tela. A casa dos Park, com sua arquitetura moderna e linhas limpas, contrasta fortemente com o por√£o escuro e claustrof√≥bico dos Kim, simbolizando as enormes disparidades sociais entre as duas fam√≠lias.
O que mais me encantou foi a cr√≠tica social incisiva que ""Parasita"" oferece. O filme faz um paralelo poderoso entre as classes sociais, explorando a din√¢mica entre o pai rico e o pai pobre. Essas subvers√µes de previsibilidade s√£o brilhantes; sempre que pensei que sabia o que estava para acontecer, o filme dava uma reviravolta inesperada, desafiando minhas expectativas e me mantendo alerta. Essa habilidade de surpreender o espectador √© uma das maiores for√ßas do filme.
Al√©m disso, ""Parasita"" evita categorizar seus personagens em her√≥is e vil√µes de maneira expl√≠cita. A complexidade moral dos personagens faz com que voc√™ sinta empatia por todos, apesar de suas falhas e a√ß√µes question√°veis. Voc√™ se encontra torcendo e n√£o torcendo por cada personagem ao mesmo tempo, preso na narrativa que desafia as no√ß√µes tradicionais de certo e errado. O filme √© habilidoso ao apresentar a cr√≠tica social sem manique√≠smos, destacando que a luta entre classes n√£o tem vencedores claros; a pobreza e o desespero afetam todos de maneiras diferentes.
O inc√¥modo da pobreza, simbolizado pelo cheiro que permeia tanto a fam√≠lia rica quanto a pobre, √© um toque de genialidade. Esse detalhe, t√£o sutil e ao mesmo tempo t√£o significativo, encapsula a maneira como ""Parasita"" aborda suas tem√°ticas. Cada gesto, cada express√£o, carrega um peso maior, comunicando tanto sem precisar ser expl√≠cito.
A narrativa paralela entre as duas fam√≠lias permite um contraste fascinante. √â poss√≠vel ver as similaridades e diferen√ßas entre elas, e isso enriquece ainda mais a experi√™ncia do filme. ""Parasita"" n√£o s√≥ faz um coment√°rio sobre a desigualdade social, mas tamb√©m nos faz refletir sobre as contrapartes de cada personagem, sobre suas motiva√ß√µes e circunst√¢ncias. Essa complexidade √© o que torna o filme uma obra de arte.
Em resumo, ""Parasita"" √© uma obra-prima cinematogr√°fica que merece todos os elogios que recebeu. √â um filme que transcende g√™neros e expectativas, oferecendo uma experi√™ncia envolvente e reflexiva. A dire√ß√£o impec√°vel, as atua√ß√µes poderosas e a cr√≠tica social profunda se combinam para criar um filme que √© tanto encantador quanto perturbador."
2025-03-05,5.0,"Yup, still peak.
Parasite is one of the best movies of the 2010s, and one of the most deserving and agreed upon best pictures in all the Oscars history. Its a masterpiece of a film, blending so many different genres in a way that goes seamlessly, a train of many of Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs movies. Its knows when to be funny, when to be intense and when to be scary. One of the most well directed movies of recent years, its a flawless film in terms of technical skill with amazing shot compositions, editing, lighting and production design. The cast is absolutely sublime, with the two standouts being the great Kang-ho Song and Park So-dam who plays the amazing daughter character Ki Jung. The horror/thriller elements are absolutely haunting, and a great ticking time bomb to build tension with the audience until the inevitable conclusion (one of the most intense and INSANE movie endings of all time). Parasite tells a story about the plight of poor and low income families as they must sneak, struggle and pit against eachother in competition to be able to even live while working for rich people who live in absolute luxury. It paints a perfect picture of the wealthy‚Äôs lack of empathy and how the rest of us have to suffer for it. The film both concisely and tragically hammers home the unfortunately ever relevant point that the true parasites on society are rich people. As its always been, the only real war is class war.
Not much else I can say, its fucking Parasite, you all already know its a masterpiece and already considered one of the greats. It feels like a quality of filmmaking we rarely see these days, helped by just every aspect of the movie being executed to supreme potential. Its social commentary on class and wealth inequality becomes only more relevant with time, especially with the rise of evil, unelected billionaires like Elon Musk. Parasite is a must see for any so called fans of Cinema, getting my highest recommendation! Rewatch has cemented both this and Bong Joon-ho as favourites of mine, and I eagerly await seeing Mickey 17.

Who, exactly, is the parasite here: the poor family who infiltrate into the rich family's mansion and taking advantage on their wealth, or the rich family that leeches off the poor family's labour while living a life of fancy luxury and privilege?

With all the attention given at the time, I don't have anything new to add. It's all been said already, so I'll just drop this here: Bong's Academy Award acceptance speech for Best Director: Parasite, which just shows the humility of the guy. Wonderful.
Thank you. After winning best international feature, I thought I was done for the day and was ready to relax.
Thank you so much. When I was young and studying cinema, there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is that ""The most personal is the most creative.""
That quote is from our great Martin Scorsese. When I was in school, I studied Martin Scorsese's films. Just to be nominated was a huge honor. I never thought I would win.
When people in the U.S. were not familiar with my films, Quentin [Tarantino] always put my films on his list. He's here, thank you so much. Quentin, I love you.
And Todd [Phillips] and Sam [Mendes], great directors that I admire. If the Academy allows, I would like to get a Texas chainsaw, split the award into five and share it with all of you.
Thank you. I will drink until next morning, thank you."
2023-07-02,5.0,"Wow, I am in shock on how good this film is. Parasite is a masterpiece. I loved every single minute of it and couldn't keep my eyes off it. This film is perfect with the setting, characters, story, and score. Bong Joon Ho is an amazing director, and I really need to see his other films. I was speechless when the credits rolled, and I kinda just sat there speechless. The cast is great, especially the main family. This is a brilliant film about greed and what it does to people. This film had a brilliant ending, which I'm still taken back at how good it was. This film mixes the genres of horror, thriller, and a bit of comedy.

This film deserved the best picture award at the oscars. This was my first ever Korean film and I loved it, I need to see more now. I loved how most of this film is in one setting with the main story centres around it. I loved the twist in the film. It literally caught me off guard. It was so good. If you've haven't seen this film yet you should watch it. You won't regret it. It is truly a masterpiece."
2022-08-07,5.0,"I have saved the best for last and indeed I did. This is easily my favorite film from Bong Joon-ho. Although, I thought it was kind of overrated when I first saw it because I didn‚Äôt get it and I was new to foreign films at the time. Now that I‚Äôm used to seeing foreign movies and how films structured, I absolutely loved it! 
The directing is masterful and the writing is brilliant. It‚Äôs a blend of his signature style with a mix of Hitchcock, and it has a fresh and new story too. It‚Äôs filled with clever ideas and many great scenes here, but the one that stood out the most was the montage scene. That scene is just genius. Almost every scene is filled with high stakes and tension at every corner, especially when the second half gets more crazier as it continues. All of the performances were great, but Song Kang-ho should‚Äôve got a Oscar nomination for this. I even like how the film was shot and it has this smooth and clean look to it. 
While it‚Äôs not my favorite film of all time, I can now say it‚Äôs one of the best films out there. It easily deserves the best picture win and it‚Äôs the only time a film deserved it too. This just shows that Bong Joon-ho is one of the best directors working today, but it‚Äôs also a sign that originality is still alive."

2019-08-13,3.0,"Bong Joon-ho lays it on thick, doesn't he? ""Do you even allegory, bro?""
The first half of Parasite is a (bad) comedy about a family of grifters, or maybe they're a family that just decided to grift right now, it's a little unclear, but it plays like a Hollywood reimagining of Shoplifters, but without any of the subtlety or nuance. For most of this section, I was dumbfounded that this cornball comedy of class stereotypes with plot manipulations straight out of an '80s teen comedy had attained instant classic status.
The second half of Parasite has a revelation that sends it into becoming a different movie, a much better movie, for my tastes. Still laying it on thick, you got the lower classes literally fighting for the same scraps in a basement (OMG the level below the rich! don't you get it?), but this is Bong Joon-ho after all, this is what he does for better and for worse, and it now feels more like one of his films.
Even still, it quickly reverts back to the lite tone of the first half with people hiding underneath beds and coffee tables like it's a TGIF sitcom, but it's building to a climax that you sense is inevitable, and as it turns out, is inevitable. Although there is a Chabrol film that did this climax significantly better and it's never a great sign when a movie just makes you think about a better one.
After the climax, there's a 15 minute epilogue. It is totally different than the first two hours, a bit novelistic, rare vagueness as to whether it's real or imagined, and by far my favorite part. As someone that was lukewarm on this Palme d'Or winning instant classic for the first two hours, I can't help but project that this epilogue had people leaving the film in a cinematic high. That last/best impression either elevating the first two hours for those that liked or loved it, or for those like me who were lukewarm, giving them amnesia of those first two hours with the bludgeoning of a great ending, both resulting in its near universal praise and current standing as the 7th best movie ever here at Letterboxd. I suppose I fit somewhere in the latter, only without the amnesia about those first two hours.
Parasite might still make the lower part of my top 10 favorites of the year so far, but I found it significantly less than its current reputation and am bummed about it. For me, Parasite cements Bong Joon-ho's Hollywood and post-Hollywood career as a sort of arthouse Christopher Nolan; a technical genius with a heavy hand, making audiences feel smarter than they actually are by spelling out the message, which is why I suspect this is the preferred ""foreign movie"" for people who never watch foreign movies. They can feel pleased with themselves while thinking, ""Oh, I do get this metaphor,"" as this homogenized version of this type of movie becomes easier to digest, which also makes it destined to be a favorite for the most basic taste award shows. This is not inherently a bad thing, Parasite is better than most films celebrated so universally like this. At least Bong Joon-ho has something meaningful to say (unlike Nolan), and it's correct as far as I'm concerned, I just wish he didn't feel the need to put everything on the surface, all the time, over and over again; to create these worlds without subtext, only boldfaced text.
This is a good film, sometimes a very good one, but I think it falls well short of masterpiece. I look forward to observing its reputation in five years, where I think when the momentum dies down it will reduce to some degree. In the meantime, you can fight me about Parasite in the basement, where I am, and will always be."

2019-08-20,4.5,"Bong Joon Ho's Parasite is a really return to form for the South Korean director, leaving the fantasy genre aside and going back to a much grounded direction that still embraces the fun and social commentary we've come to love from him, creating a flawless masterwork and a great, very entertaining exercise on tension.
The camera work doesn't hit the same highs as, say, Memories of Murder, but there are still awesome photography work and framing. With a few scenes reminding me to the work of his counterpart, Chan-Soon Park.
The message as a whole was very polarizing to me, mostly because of a script that sometimes asks for audience too much and very little reason to embrace them (HINT: The very ending). That being said, there are some fun lines, moments and its very smart most of the time.

Crazy how 2020 just stopped being good after this movie won Best Picture."
2019-10-06,5.0,"Now that I‚Äôve formed the thoughts I need to review this, let me just say that my expectations for this film was far beyond what I perceived. Bong has always had a way of using tragedy and class dynamics as a tool to drive a narrative, and this was no different. Where do I even start?
I am unsettled, first of all. Whenever you think the climax closes in on its peak, Bong taps your head in a few more times (no pun intended). This happens constantly and I believe the film is aware of that. It uses our sympathy towards the Kims, our anger towards the Parks, and our fear for anticipation all to meticulously. This film pushed my limits progressively without me knowing. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to think about it, but it‚Äôs painful to see how this film embodies its stories in more ways than one. Eventually, it forms a masterpiece that leaves you thinking about the emotions you went through.
Song Kang-ho never shows anything minor when it comes to taking on an unsettling variety of roles. His performances are stunning and this is only one of his best ones.
Choi Woo-shik and Park So-Dam need to be offered everything for these performances. This was the film that used their talents to the best of their ability. The supporting actor/actress campaign starts now.
I cant even explain how this film made me feel and that‚Äôs what I love about it. It left me completely incomprehensible towards my emotions, but it did make it memorable. No other film has made me emote the way I did. Bong is leading a new chapter in cinema, and I‚Äôll keep waiting to see what else his genius has in store."
2025-03-05,5.0,very tempted to put this film into my top 4.
2024-03-03,5.0,Is this the most deserving best picture win of all time?
2020-11-12,4.0,"Perhaps the most explicit class commentary in recent years on the divide between the wealth class and the working class, much in the same way that American Beauty explicitly hit home with the generation yearning to escape the empty and soulless cubicle existence in 1999. Both films perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the moment, skyrocketed in popularity, and grabbed a plethora of awards including Best Picture at the Oscars.
The primary difference is that nobody gives a flying fuck about American Beauty anymore, and not only because of Kevin Spacey. It's simply not a film that resonates as strongly today as it did in 1999. The worries of yesterday differ from the worries of today. A person struggling financially might find it difficult to relate to a guy who is sad but otherwise has everything he could ever want. Lester just needed to grow the fuck up and realize how nice he's got it. Motherfucker wouldn't know a real problem if it foreclosed on his $350,000 suburban home.
I think Parasite will have more longevity than American Beauty because there always were class struggles in America and there likely always will be. However, I do not believe that Parasite will always be viewed as a masterpiece film, one of the all-time greats, or held in a higher esteem than it is currently. Films that capture the zeitgeist of their time seldom (if ever) can maintain their status as time goes by, even if their themes still resonate, and if the films succeed greatly in cinematic terms.
Parasite is a gorgeous movie with excellent cinematography, wonderful music, flawless editing, and hardly any weak areas to speak of (the same could be said about American Beauty). Cinematically, it's fantastic.
Story-wise, it works more often than it doesn't. The characters are rather stock, however, and don't excel outside of their physical function within the story. I won't call them shallow, but I will say that the depth of the movie does not come from its characters. The depth comes from its themes, metaphors, and how well they are woven into the fabric of the movie from start to finish. A LOT of thought was put into this part of the movie, but I don't feel that as much care was given to other areas.
Speaking of characters, why is this family not working at the beginning of the story if we see them later on possessing the drive and the skills to actually make money? Why is the father not driving? Why is the daughter not doing graphic design on Fiverr or something? I would have preferred if there was more present in the film in the way of there not being opportunity for these otherwise skilled and driven people, but the best we get is a single line about how a job opening for a security guard has 500 applicants or some shit, which speaks more to the father's world view and less about whether or not that is indeed their reality. Is it? We have no idea. We needed to actually see that reality in order to understand it, and in order for it to be an actual element of this story. Otherwise, there is no reason for these bumbling fools who can't even fold cardboard somehow simultaneously being excellent at driving, wonderful at cooking, and exceedingly competent at every single thing asked of them. The way the movie is constructed, it feels contrived. These people are either skilled or they are not. It can't be both ways, but the movie wants it to be.
The entire first half of the movie is dedicated to moving the pieces around the chessboard to get the story started proper. That is a long time to set everything up, and I cannot see that part of the film being as captivating on repeat viewings. We don't find out about the secret basement until the midpoint when the poor family inexplicably lets the former maid into the home. That came off as a contrivance for the story to keep moving. Why not just ask the lady what she left in the basement? They didn't even bother to ask! At least ask. And why was she beat up and bloody? That was never explained. This moment would have worked better if she wasn't bloody, because then the poor family would have no reason not to let her in. But if she shows up looking like she just got in a fight, that begs some questions that unfortunately were not asked. It's little things like this that can be very easily fixed that irk me the most. Just take a second and fix this. It's literally not hard at all and would take little effort while not affecting the rest of the movie. There is no reason for these kinds of issues existing in a movie so otherwise meticulous in every detail.
The second half of the film is rich with cliche, and I found myself ahead of the story on several occasions. Obviously the family was coming home early, so that was not a surprise at all to anyone who has seen one movie before in their lifetime. And the whole bit about the ""ghost"" coming up from the basement just as the son was receiving his ""trauma-recovery cake"" could be seen coming from 20 minutes away. Additionally, the whole deal about morse code came out of nowhere and ultimately served only to present a way for the father in the basement to communicate with his son in a manner that was insufficiently established. Furthermore, I feel that a lot more could have been done with the secret basement, and a lot more could have been done if the entire first 65 minutes were not dedicated to setup.
Overall, I feel as if what this movie has to say, and the many layers in which it is said, is a lot more interesting than the film which is used to say it. It isn't a bad movie, but it's not a masterpiece, either. Not by any stretch. If you want to see a real South Korean masterpiece, watch Burning."
2019-10-11,3.5,"Here goes for spoilers:







SPOILERS









This reminded me of the French film, La C√©r√©monie."
2022-09-04,4.5,"Hey, this is actually a great frickin' movie. Who knew?
Yeah, yeah, everyone and their mother knew. As always, I am super late watching one of the most celebrated movies of the past five years. What else is new? At least I am consistent.
I am really glad to have now finally seen Parasite though. This was right up my alley. I love how dark/morbid it eventually became. Absolutely delicious.
I had a blast watching this with Michelle."
2019-10-12,5.0,"I guess only someone like Bong Joon-ho could have made a comedy/drama/thriller about internal class manipulation and social invisible war, without ever surrendering itself into becoming politically partisan to one side in diminish of the other (left wing more specifically), as some usual filmmakers tend to appeal; and make a small masterpiece like Parasite out of that! Maybe his most inspired directing and writing ever since Mistery of Murder dare I say. Where every single detail going behind this movie works beautifully well on screen that lets you know since the start that this is a master‚Äôs movie and nothing below that.
The camera work is spot on, where the mise-en-scene may be the best made this year, easy, specially taking the almost-one stage scenario in where most of the movie inhabits (I seriously want to live in this house); the meticulous editing has a life of its own and the pacing is so well rounded that makes you wishing for more when it‚Äôs about to end; the script is so tight in its narrative control and density of both the evoke of its high social themes and the moral complexity of every single one of its multi-layered characters, and once again giving my boy Song Kang-ho brilliant material to him work of his great talent; the mix of genres going at each other its phenomenal to say the least, and maybe one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen. How it starts of as HILARIOUS comedy that INSTANTENEOUSLY morphs into a high suspense (almost horror) thriller and that ends on a dramatic tragedy note evoking all the right emotions, its brilliant to spare!
I have nothing but compliment to be giving here to this beauty, even the ending that threatened to be the low key part of quality of the movie for me, manage to happily surprised me in its highly reflexive final note. Where the final minutes adopts that rapid-fire narration over the succeeding events and actions instead of really devoting extra time to showing them, that really pisses me of, but Joon-ho makes it here with the right amount of narration and visual storytelling, enough to hit hard the final emotions of its great story quite effectively and to sound so universally relatable. After all, we all dream to crawl out our life's misery by earning and winning the capitalist laurels that form the moral and ethical visibility dictated by our socio-cultural material goods and behaviors, and through that, maybe make forget and forgive our mistakes and dark secrets of the past that our greed parasite nature may forced us to commit.
The main allegory couldn‚Äôt be more clear! And the big highlighted plan theme of the film, it might just be a plan to escape thus life of poverty crushed by the wealth of the system. But if Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground already illustrated very well, and visibly inspired the optics that the film takes, it is that the feeling of revolt and refusal against society and all that symbolizes it in the vicious circle of class interdependence and hypocritical subjugations and underestimations, also reflects our inner cravings for wanting to belong at any cost to survive. And all the tragicomedy that becomes present in this system of our daily lives, is the working realism behind Parasite, where the final catharsis is to have no catharsis at all, just like in our lives."
2019-07-30,4.5,"When I watched Okja I was immediately taken by just how new it seemed. From the very first scene it appeared to be something completely fresh. 
Parasite takes a slightly different approach. It begins as relatively normal but builds into something that surprises you, and then does it again, and then again, and then a few more times for good measure.
If I was asked to, I don‚Äôt think I could describe what Parasite is about. Family and the class system are prominent themes but it is much more complex than that.
On a technical level it‚Äôs flawless. Everything from the camerawork, lighting, set design, acting and the script is on another level.
This is one of the most tense movies I‚Äôve seen in a while. And I watched Psycho yesterday. This movie goes through every single emotion possible, it knows when to be funny, when to be heart-wrenching and when to be any of the other unique, complex mixes of emotion it manages to pull from nowhere, without ever feeling inauthentic or rushed.
There are many characters in Parasite, but it never becomes confusing or hard to keep track of them. All of them are perfectly developed and feel natural and real. 
I loved the experience of watching this. My Dad and I were in the cinema alone and I kinda felt angry that no other people were getting to see it. I won‚Äôt be forgetting this in a hurry that‚Äôs for sure."
2025-07-06,5.0,"The rich never notice what‚Äôs beneath them , until it‚Äôs too late. Parasite isn‚Äôt just about money, it's about the quiet ways people rot for survival, how far you‚Äôll crawl to breathe the same air as them. Every room hides something, every smile feels sharp. It‚Äôs bitter, beautiful and leaves you sick in the best way"
2025-06-19,4.5,i think everyone should punch me in the face (this is my first time watching parasite)
2024-08-01,5.0,"""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho is a film that, even upon a second viewing, manages to deeply impress and astonish. The complexity of the plot and the impeccable development of the story offer a sharp and penetrating look at delicate themes such as family and social class.
The narrative is structured in a way that constantly keeps the viewer's attention high, alternating moments of tension with instances of reflection and dark humor. The ease with which the film addresses and intertwines these topics is extraordinary, demonstrating rare sensitivity and depth.
The score and cinematography are exemplary, contributing to create an immersive and nuanced atmosphere. Every shot is meticulously crafted, every musical note perfectly synchronized with the emotions unfolding on screen.
The acting is simply masterful from the entire cast. Each actor, from the leads to the supporting characters, delivers a performance that further enriches the complexity and realism of the story.
The ending is incredible and satisfying, perhaps one of the best ever. The conclusion manages to surprise, move, and leave a profound reflection, closing the narrative circle impeccably.
This movie is simply perfect. Masterpiece"

The main characters are not necessarily nice people, but they aren't evil either. You never really know if you like what they're doing or not. Showing them at their worst, their best and their even worse still keeps things interesting. You'll never know where this story is going, it keeps you thinking.

Literally jaw droppingly good. Our takeaway arrived within the last 20 minutes and I could barely touch it because I was so enthralled with the film.

In Parasite, an unemployed family slowly works their way into getting jobs with a highly trusting and rich family. Once involved with the family a dramatic turn shows just how desperate many people are to gain employment and survive. EAT THE FUCKING RICH! this movie is fucking fantastic.
I'd like to see this at least a few more times but I already think this is one of the best films of the year. Bong Joon-ho manages to perfectly illustrate how humanity is divided by class and the underlying violence that's present in class conflict. The performances are magnificent and the pacing is spot on for a 2 plus hour movie.
YES, see this as soon as you can."

2019-11-03,4.5,"I'm not the world's biggest Bong Joon-ho fan (loved Memories of Murder, liked The Host and Okja, didn't care for Snowpiercer and Mother) but there's no doubt he's one of the bigger filmmaking talents working today. With Parasite he's pretty much worked towards all his strengths and delivered one of the most creative, entertainingly bonkers films I've ever seen.
I haven't had great experiences with a couple of the recently super-hyped South Korean films (The Wailing, The Handmaiden), but this certainly lives up to expectations. Go in knowing as little as possible and let go as Joon-ho masterfully manoeuvers around genre and tone in what will surely end up the most unusual hit of 2019."
2019-08-27,5.0,"TIFF 2019 Film #2: Special Presentations (Canadian Premiere)
Alongside names like Park Chan-wook, Lee Chang-dong, or Kim Jee-woon, Bong Joon-ho is one among the most widely recognizable of South Korea‚Äôs own auteurs but his own approach to genre cinema is every bit as distinguishable from the rest. With his willingness to flourish in black comedy, there‚Äôs no doubt that Bong Joon-ho can create some of the most entertaining films of his kind. With his newest film, Bong Joon-ho goes a whole other route and creates a social satire unlike any other ‚Äì one that beautifully mixes elements of mystery, thriller, comedy in a matter that‚Äôs almost unfathomable in Parasite. It‚Äôs a film of an indescribable beauty, but for every moment that surprises its own viewers there‚Äôs also something more meaningful to be found on the inside. Like all of Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs movies, it only promises more and more as it finds ways to feed your expectations and to say that all of them are met with Parasite is a mere understatement, it‚Äôs a film that creeps up on you slowly and transforms so much more than what you‚Äôre seeing on the surface.

2025-03-09,5.0,"It felt so refreshing to see this again for the second time after seeing it back in May of last year, and despite me missing the IMAX rerelease. 

After Okja, I think Bong knew what he had to do, and it was to go back to the roots that The Host and Memories of Murder showed, and he did just that. Parasite is one of the best films from the 2010s, both masterful and thrilling all around, and with incredible performances and fantastic chemistry from this wonderful cast. A clever story that shows themes including class conflict, social inequality, wealth disparity, and shows differences between a poor family like the Kims, and a rich family like the Parks, and all throughout it‚Äôs well-crafted in a story that i‚Äôm invested all the way through. I know in my first review I said it was weird, but it was my first time seeing a foreign film (excluding anime of course), but now I appreciate the hell out of it and love it from top to bottom. From Joon-ho‚Äôs direction, cinematography, and shots all throughout (even the unsettling ones), this film is one the best, Bong‚Äôs magnum opus, with Memories of Murder right next to it, I mean both are phenomenal in their own way.
Today I was eying on buying the 4K version of it (not the Criterion), but unfortunately had to pass on it due to me being broke, however, it was very nice to see it when I got home from the Mall to forget all about passing on it. Besides that, I pretty much love this film, it‚Äôs not my favourite from Bong. but it certainly is a magnificent film that deserved every award it won. With Mickey 17 now out, I hope it can be enjoyable from the reviews I‚Äôve read, so he can have a nice follow up from this masterpiece.
EDIT: I bought the 4K when I went to the mall again. along with other films as well. (my wallet is crying)

I waited to see it so long because of the title because I thought that it was going to be another type of movie. Give it a try if you haven‚Äôt already.
2020-02-12,5.0,"I could imagine the reaction an audience member would have to seeing The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption for the first time at its release is similar to how we treat this movie. Already it‚Äôs claimed best of all time status as Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs perfect genre blend of dark comedy, thriller and social satire makes for one of the greatest films I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of seeing. Stunning visual storytelling that differentiates the two classes of these families without feeling on the nose or protentious. For instance a rain storm to the Parks might seem like a beautiful thing but to people like the Kims it‚Äôs a detriment and a destructive force that will inflict massive damage on their home. He demonstrates two different meanings of an event for two different classes all done with stunning symbolism and breathtaking cinematography. While being a technical mastery it‚Äôs also extremely funny and the type of humour implemented is so smart and clever and it stays true to the kind of characters these people are. Unlike a lot of other ‚Äúhollywoodised‚Äù films the lower class characters are portrayed as extremely intelligent people because they have to be to survive. The way that they widdle themselves into exclusive positions with this high class family is extremely clever and well done. As well as that the wealthy family isn‚Äôt portrayed as complete villains or idiots. The film doesn‚Äôt give you a reason to hate them, but you can also see where the lower class family is coming from as their hatred and anger towards these people begins to  grow. But there‚Äôs a certain point in the story where the film shifts and no longer remains funny and turns into an extremely serious film. I‚Äôm almost tempted to use the word scary when describing the events that occur, and I say that because everything that happens feels plausible and real. There‚Äôs no glitz or glamour sugar coated over the top of this dark and twisted story. The subtle imagery shown throughout the film creates its own narrative and makes you understand where each of these characters are coming from. Where a lot of films fall short is not knowing when they‚Äôre showing too much and this film understands that brilliantly and leaves a lot to be ambiguous and it works perfectly. It makes you create scenarios in your head as to what will happen to these characters, what will they do tomorrow? When a film has you thinking about it long after you watch it, you know you have a classic on your hands and that‚Äôs exactly what Parasite is."
2020-02-07,5.0,"Parasite is a brilliant film, a compelling story, excellently told, full of irony, satire, nuance and dramatic tension. Parasite is an intriguing look at class and privilege. It's evident that the Kim's can never truly ascend to the dizzy, luxuried heights of their masters, the Park's, but in a world where so many have so little and wealth is in the hands of the few, who then are the Parasites?"
2020-06-29,5.0,"‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Park!‚Äù
If Parasite isn‚Äôt a flawless film, it‚Äôs pretty damn close.  Crisp, vibrant cinematography highlight unparalleled writing, acting, directing & seamless editing. While easily my pick for best picture of the year, Parasite is possibly the best picture of the decade.

Hard not to see this for the ship-in-a-bottle it truly is, but equally as hard not to admire the workmanlike construction regardless‚Äîso beautiful and formally sharp at times that it almost hurts. But Bong‚Äôs bleeding passion comes at the cost of nuance. No disguising his class warfare agendas here: The poor are so desperate that their collective talents - which, by the way, reads slightly implausible to me; wouldn‚Äôt someone with e.g. photoshop skills as deft as Ki-jung be able to land a legitimate job somewhere? This family seems too smart to have wound up on skid row in the first place - are channeled toward ruthless ends, competence translating directly into self-serving corruption. On the other hand, the rich are so filthy rich that they‚Äôre both oblivious to the way they‚Äôre trampling on the backs of those less fortunate and apparently in short supply of anything resembling common sense. (Your entire personal staff needing replacements within the same week should raise a red flag for any functioning human being. Does having lots of money make you immeasurably gullible by nature?) Either way, I found myself directly engaged with the craftsmanship, and while the socioeconomic separation is drawn to uncomfortable extremes, the sheer precision of the clicking gears - the systematic way Kim‚Äôs family absorbs themselves into the Park household in titular fashion - mitigated much of my distress over the boldly outlined archetyping. Mid-film revelation (err..twist? I guess?) successfully blindsided me, but also promised a more satisfying closure of the Poor vs. Poor narrative i.e., the point I originally thought the film was trying to make. (Ultimately, the Kim family‚Äôs forceful usurping of the existing middle-to-lower-class staff has no real repercussions to the Park family. Sure, their children aren‚Äôt getting ‚Äúproperly‚Äù tutored, but it‚Äôs evident they weren‚Äôt before, either, and anyway, they‚Äôre completely okay [and/or sufficiently stupid enough] to overpay without proper evidence of worthiness.) In essence, I thought it was a keen commentary on the poor fighting among themselves instead of combining their efforts and resisting upward. All of that implodes during the birthday party fiasco, though, unraveling any thematic coherence and trading the strands for ultra-gonzo mayhem and lots of last-minute hairpinning. (The morse code coda: yuck.) I had similar thoughts on MEMORIES OF A MURDER: The surface-level pleasures and screenplay intricacy have undeniable magnetism, but the boffo elements are simply unpleasant to me, especially when laid up against a scenario that‚Äôs at least partially attempting practicality."

2020-02-07,5.0,"Parasite is a brilliant film, a compelling story, excellently told, full of irony, satire, nuance and dramatic tension. Parasite is an intriguing look at class and privilege. It's evident that the Kim's can never truly ascend to the dizzy, luxuried heights of their masters, the Park's, but in a world where so many have so little and wealth is in the hands of the few, who then are the Parasites?"

I don't think I've enjoyed the pacing in a movie as much as I have this one (so far this year) and it's truly a shame considering all the 2 hour messes I've had to sit through.
The acting was great and it obviously looked rich as hell.
My only gripe is with the party scene. But the ending got me right in the feelings. Who knows. I can see this one being a five star with a rewatch.

These films are considered the best for a reason, and while there are some I think are worth their place more than others (not completely convinced Get Out deserves to be there), Parasite completely deserves its place. Whether in ten years it will have stood the test of time as L'Avventura has demonstrated since its release (though its march backwards through the Top 100 doesn't inspire much hope for its presence in 2032) is a different matter, but I'm willing to bet that its excellence on all fronts will keep it in good stead.

2020-10-27,5.0,WHAT CAN I REALLY SAY I MEAN
2020-05-25T20:49:01.668Z,5.0,"INSANE MASTERPIECE.
It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.
It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.
Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".
It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.
It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.
Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.
At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.
Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.
That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.
And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.
However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.
With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.
The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.
Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand."

2025-03-31,5.0,"""You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next.""
The love I have for Bong Joon Ho is growing day by day. He is such a talented film-maker, with each one of his films being incredibly put together with immaculate precision, as well as having the most dark, witty and yet intelligent screenplays out there. 'Parasite' is a masterpiece. I was in awe for most of this film. And honestly, I still am, even whilst writing this review.
To put it simply, this film follows two families: one being rich, and the other being poor. It depicts the poor family's attempt to infiltrate the rich family and the house that they live in. This initial premise is explored in such a fresh and unique way, making for such an immense opening to this film. The house in particular reminded me oddly to that of Kubrick's interpretation of the Overlook Hotel. Bong Joon Ho masterfully maintain this feel of uncertainty, espcially as the house begins to uncover the true colours of each of these characters. These are elements used by both directors, yet Bong Joon Ho does it in way that feels so rejuvinated to anyone that has done it before. 
One of the things I love most about this films narrative, is how the story feels weirdly realistic. This is something that could actually happen, yet there are enough moments here that feel larger than life, which helps to create this escapism. Moreover, its ability to be a very funny and playful film in that escapism, is so powefully flipped on its head with scenes coated in that bleak and sad reality of poverty, as it never feels jarring to watch. This is a film that will manipulate you intellectually and emotionally, you feel it is genuinely controlling you in all the best ways, and once it's over, it doesn't let go. 
'Parasite' is very much a visual feast. It makes the most out of the few locations, and they shoot the house in very inventive ways. By the end of the film, the house is just as much of a character as the two families in the film. But even on the outside there are some mind-bending shots too, one in particular perfectly highlighting the climb down of the social hierarchy during the rainstorm. This film is able to make you feel so claustrophic and yet so free and liberated in such short succession, without ruining the pacing in general. The cinematography is gorgeous, and is definitely the icing to this already delicious cake. 
I cannot believe it took me 6 whole years to watch this film, but now that I have, I need to make a few claims. Not only is this a masterpiece, it is also one of the best films to come out of the 2010s. Yeah, I said that.

2019-10-23T18:56:53.643Z,5.0,"Quick expansion/clarification of an idea from my original, more thorough review:
So we know what the Park family are being punished for by the cinematic violence done to them (they're rich, they're the parasite), but what did the poor Kim family do to deserve their punishment? Why does Kim Ki-taek end up in the basement, presumably forever? We can find a clue in the meaning of their last name: ""Kim"" means gold, and while the Kim family starts with little to no wealth, once they get a taste for it they become greedy for more, and as is made clear in the scene where they get drunk in the Park house while the family is out, they would be happy living this bourgeois lifestyle. The Kim family is punished for being class traitors.
(Bong Joon-ho does this thing in most of his movies where he begins with essentially sympathetic protagonists and then problematizes their position, the clearest example being the detectives in Memories of Murder, who are trying to solve a case of serial rape but who use violent torture methods on someone with a mental disability. I think the only one of his films I've seen without this complexity of its protagonist is Okja?)

2022-05-18,4.5,"I've never paused a movie so many damn time.
Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece Parasite is a gift that keep on giving. A chaotic comedy thriller drama that builds its character while presenting a darkly humorous structure of class divide. Satirical movies often is indulged with interesting character arcs and intelligent plots that disrubs and compels at the same time, but Parasite's layered twists and superbly tense last 40 mins is entertaining at least, enthralling at most.

When I heard rumors surrounding this movie, I had it in my mind that some supernatural elements existed. However, everything is portrayed very realistically with superb cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong. 
It starts out with the Kim family: a mom, dad, brother, and sister. They are caught in a class struggle. The fact that automation is killing jobs popped into my mind. They lived in an almost post-apocalyptic situation where food, jobs, and (gasp) Wi-Fi were hard to get. The Kim son goes to interview as a tutor for the eldest Park child, Min. 
The Park family is also composed of a rich-bitch mom, a high-level corporate dad, the holy terror younger son Da-song, and shy middle sister Da-hye. They are all products of wealth whether they like it or not. 
One of the most compelling scenes was showing the aftermath of a traumatic event that happened. The Kim family was hit hard, while the ""rich"" Park family woke up to a new day just like clockwork. 
While I liked the film a lot, I was not as impressed as I thought I might be. It's really similar to a French film I saw (will reveal the title of it in a soon-to-follow spoiler review of Parasite). I was totally emotionally disturbed by it, however, and I think that it far exceeded any merits Joker might have had. 
But‚Äî they should have given the Palme d'Or to Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You. 
Just saying.

Dengan hype begitu tinggi, pemilihan poster-nya yang membuat penasaran akut, Parasite telah menciptakan kehebohan tersendiri di kalangan pecinta film pasca Cannes, tetapi apa yang sebenarnya ditawarkan ""Parasite?"" Apakah dia horor, thriller atau komedi? Yang perlu kamu ketahui tentang ""Parasite"" itu hanya sekedar definisi umumnya saja; ""Sebuah organisme yang hidup di dalam tubuh organisme lain (inang) dan mengambil/menyedot nutrsinya"". Ya, penjelasan ilmiah itu sudah lebih dari cukup untuk menggambarkan isi ""perut"" dari film panjang ke-7 Bong Joon-ho ini, bahkan ungkapan ""Semakin sedikit yang kamu tahu semakin baik"" itu saja terasa berlebihan karena khusus untuk kasus ini ""Tidak ada sama sekali yang kamu tahu itu jauh lebih baik"".
""Parasite"" adalah kegilaan! Ya, kegilaan yang hanya bisa dibuat oleh sutradara sekaliber Bong Joon-ho yang sebelumnya pernah menelurkan karya-karya hebat lain macam ""Memories of Murder"", ""The Host"", ""Mother"" & ""Snowpiercer"". Ibarat bibimbap (nasi campurnya Korea), Parasite adalah kumpulan dari komedi hitam, heist movie, thriller home invasion, komentar sosial, drama keluarga, kematian dan darah yang semuanya dikumpulkan dalam satu mangkuk besar lalu diaduk dan dicampur dengan cara jenius yang belum pernah kamu lihat sebelumnya.
Semua kegilaan total Parasite juga dihadirkan dengan dukungan teknis level dewa, coba lihat saja pergerakan alurnya yang cerdas di mana flash back dan current event-nya terasa mulus, menghasilkan plot yang tidak hanya rapi namun sarat dengan kemarahan dan isu sosial tentang kemiskinan dan keserakahan manusia dan yang terpenting adalah Joon-ho seperti biasa, tahu persis untuk menempatkan twist dan meledakkan di saat yang tidak pernah kamu kira, cukup untuk membuatmu terjengkang karena tak siap dengan kejutan yang datang silih berganti. Lalu juga lihat bagaimana kamera Joon-ho bergerak dan menangkap setiap momen di dalamnya, bagaimana setiap kekacauan dihadirkan dengan berkelas, termasuk di dalamnya memberikan sentuhan scoring dan efek slowmo keren lagi-lagi di saat yang pas sehingga menghasilkan efek kagum dan puas disaat bersamaan. Dan terakhir tentu saja pemilihan cast jempolan. Joon-ho kembali membawa aktor favoritnya, Song Kang-ho, mencampurnya dengan cast jagoan lain macam Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Jang Hye-jin dan Park So-dam yang menghasilkan ensamble cast keluarga terbaik yang pernah dimiliki Joon-ho setelah ""The Host"".
Ya, ini adalah orkestra kegilaan pintar yang dipenuhi amarah dan sindiran tajam dari sajian home invasion thriller dengan rasa komedi hitam pekat yang tidak pernah kamu lihat sebelumnya. Sebuah kombinasi hebat dari ide cemerlang dan eksekusi brilian dari seorang Bong Joon-ho."

2019-11-02,5.0,"‚òÜ""This is so metaphorical!""‚òÜ
Believe the hype. Bonghive, bring the noise.
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, for many the most anticipated film of the year following its Palme d'or win at Cannes and subsequent raucous and ravenous reviews at festival after festival, is finally rolling out to U.S. in a slow deliberate fashion. Though I live two hours from a theatre that is showing it today, that drive is but a stone's throw away in my mind. I wasn't going to wait any longer to see this movie. And neither should you. Go to a movie theatre to see this masterpiece and support groundbreaking cinema.
You don't want to know much about the plot. So let's keep it short. The Kim family have fallen on hard times. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) is unemployed and struggles to find work to support his wife Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik). They have an infested basement apartment, steal wi-fi when they can, and make it by the skin of their teeth. One day, Ki-woo gets a break, and earns a shot at a tutoring position for the daughter of the ultra-wealthy Park family. He schemes his way into the job teaching English to 16-year-old Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and then realizes, maybe it's possible for his family to get a break too‚Ä¶
That's it, that's all you get, about the first 20 minutes of the movie. I will make you see this if I have to drive you there myself. Who lives within two hours of Delaware? (And is preferably female and single. Call me.)
Parasite at first is all about the hustle. You may have your side gigs, but the Kim family has to hustle every moment of every day. But when you are on the bottom, you do what you gotta do. And Bong Joon-ho crafts a film here -- assisted by co-screenwriter Han Jin-won -- that is so intricate, so layered, so full of metaphors as Ki-woo said himself in a very meta moment‚Ä¶ that you will be pulled in to an increasingly urgent and timely story about class, privilege, and social mobility. Here, you'll see how the other half lives, and how the other other half feeds on their souls.
Angles of dark comedy and thrills are nothing new to master filmmaker Bong, but it is turned up to 11 in Parasite. While at times lulling you into just a clever tale of brinksmanship and hardscrabble fortune -- with his signature brilliant humour and twists -- soon there's one nerve-wracking crescendo after another in what was an hour-long spiral of cascading emotion and mania. This is a dazzling, powerful, and gripping work that is unlike anything I have seen in a long long time.
Not only does Bong Joon-ho obliterate genres yet again, he has eviscerated the distinction of crowd-pleasing dramatic thrills and arthouse intelligent ""cinema."" This is the magnum opus of his untouchable career. It is a surefire hit. And it is unquestionably the best film of the year.

2023-06-15,5.0,"Dad, today I made a plan - a fundamental plan. I'm going to earn money, a lot of it. University, a career, marriage, those are all fine, but first I'll earn money. When I have money, I'll buy the house. On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard. Because the sunshine is so nice there. All you'll need to do is walk up the stairs. Take care until then. So long.
I'm such a sucker for doomed-hopeful movie endings. Where the character is expressing some kind of promise for the future that contrasts with what you're actually seeing, where you can feel the heartbreak in real time. You know they're doomed. Maybe they even know they're doomed. But they're pushing onward with hope in their heart because there's no other choice. I think of Spike Lee's 25th Hour as the ultimate example, where our protagonist's father unspools an entire lifetime of quiet success as they hit the highway together, dreaming of escape, a new identity, raising a family in a new state... only for the camera to pull up and reveal the state penitentiary exit is fast approaching, for us to realize that the man is simply going to prison and that it's all just a dream after all.
I imagine that the reason these denouements tend to grab me by the soul is that they're so painfully relatable. Happily ever after is something we all want, but this is something we actually know in our hearts.
In the case of Parasite, it's perfect because this is the condition all of us working class folks live under all the time. We know this system can eat us alive and we know that we'll never magically bootstrap ourselves and our families into the upper class. We know that at any moment, a health crisis or a lost job might send us out into the streets, shatter all the momentum we've built up in our adult lives toward a sustainable future. It sucks, but wallowing in it sucks even more. So we carry on, we keep working, we promise ourselves things will work out, and we hold out hope. Sometimes, things do work out, after all. Right?
So glad I revisited. What a beautiful, bleak, fucking hilarious picture from one of my favorite directors.

Everything in this film is so well thought out.

However for Bong Joon-Ho, he deserves all the recognition he‚Äôs getting.
I had high expectations but at the same time, I had no idea what to expect and wow, i was not let down at all. It was a fun ride and I was hooked from beginning to end. There‚Äôs lots of funny moments but as well as intense scenes. It was a perfect balance and all of it was directed so well. This is a film I‚Äôll be thinking about for a while. I haven‚Äôt seen a few of the other best picture nominees so we‚Äôll see if my mind changes but as of right now, Parasite is my top pick for winning that best picture."
2019-06-26,2.5,"Bong Joon-ho's least imaginative film to date, and (perhaps because of that fact) the least ""Bong"" film he's made. One of the things that make Bong's two international co-productions, Snowpiercer and Okja, so disappointing for me is the absence of geographical and political specificity in their critique of capitalism (and by extension, Bong‚Äôs own aesthetic specificities). In the case of Snowpiercer, Bong's commentary on class struggle is especially feeble precisely because his attack on the global capitalist order remains abstract. Okja arguably does a better job in this regard, but not by much. It seems to me that Bong has yet to recover from his international co-production malady in spite of the return to his home ground. I am baffled by David Ehrlich's vapid assertion that with Parasite, ""Bong Joon-ho has become a genre unto himself."" He might want to revisit Memories of Murder, The Host and Mother, and rethink what he wrote. At its worst, Parasite feels like a parody of Bong‚Äôs greatest hits. 
In one interview, Bong cites Chabrol's La C√©r√©monie, Losey's The Servant, and Kim Ki-young's The Housemaid as influences on Parasite. Unfortunately, his namedropping doesn't do much more than displaying his good taste. It is not that I could not find any connections between Parasite and these three films. I could, especially on a thematic level. However, what Parasite has to say about class relations is so superficial and cynical that I start to wonder what it is that Bong took away from the three indisputable masterworks.
Of the three films mentioned, The Housemaid is the most essential‚Äîin fact, Kim Ki-young's entire filmography is foundational to Bong's aesthetics. He has reappropriated Kim's brand of upstairs-downstairs drama and jet-black comedy to great effects in his better films. In Parasite, however, The Housemaid is more of a signpost than an inspiration. To me, the social structure in which the three family units in Parasite move around and how their movements are visually represented are reminiscent of Snowpiercer, not The Housemaid. Like Snowpiercer, Parasite is a ""horizontal"" film. The difference between the two, however, is that the train is in motion, whereas the luxurious mansion is motionless. This is where the cynicism I pointed out earlier comes from. The dubious ending of Snowpiercer aside, the fact that the train is a moving object signifies that the system is a historical entity‚Äîwhich is to say that change is a possibility. In Parasite, on the other hand, the system (the mansion) is essentially a transhistorical entity that is not liable to change. Yona and Timmy step outside the Snowpiercer; Ki-woo must perpetuate capitalist exploits in order to return to the mansion (though it is all for the sake of reuniting with his father). Contrary to what some critics (including Amy Taubin) believe, this is not a Marxist film, but a liberal left film.
Of course, I do not have to agree with a film's politics in order to appreciate it. However, I am not very impressed with Bong's technical achievements in Parasite either. It is rather deft of Bong to have left out Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Shohei Imamura when he discussed the artistic influences on his latest work. To be fair, he has repeatedly acknowledged his debt to the Japanese masters in the past. His Sight & Sound poll submission includes Cure and Vengeance is Mine. What I find interesting is that of all the films he has made thus far, Parasite is the film in which Bong tries the hardest to emulate the kind of grotesqueness and eeriness found in K. Kurosawa's and Imamura's works. Did Bong feel it was unnecessary to namedrop these two because he has done so many times in the past? Could it be that Bong forgot to do so? Or did he not want people to know where he was taking his ideas from? Only Bong knows the answer."

Director Bong Joon-ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade. Mind-blowing. Deserves that Oscar. He masterfully explores the class divide, exposing the invisible walls between the rich and the poor. With stunning cinematography, sharp writing, and unforgettable twists, it keeps you hooked till the very end. Parasite is not just a movie, it's an unforgettable mirror to society.

So glad I rewatched this masterpiece. One of my favorite movies of all time. I LOVE Memories of Murder, but in my opinion, Parasite is Bong Joon-Ho‚Äôs magnum opus. I know a lot of people think it‚Äôs overrated, but I have to disagree. It‚Äôs executed perfectly, and it skillfully explores complex themes of capitalism, class consciousness, class conflict, and wealth disparity. 
It also boggles my mind how there are people who think this movie demonizes poor people when it does the exact opposite. They are not the villains in this film. The true villain and parasite??? Systemic inequality. As shown in the film, systemic inequality forces people into desperate and dangerous situations, which can result in tragedy.

2025-07-13,4.0,"The theme of social class distinction in Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is not a backdrop but is actually the engine driving its dark comedy and tragic narrative. The film thrives on the chasm between the wealthy Park family and the impoverished Kim family through an array of cinematic devices and character interactions.
The literal architectural divide is obvious, with the Kims' semi-basement dwelling perpetually exposed to the chaos of the street, contrasted against the Parks' sprawling and meticulous modern mansion, the film immediately establishes a visual hierarchy. The literal physical elevation of the Parks mirrors the social ladder, with the Kims constantly struggling upwards, in vain, while the Parks reside in a lofty ignorance of troubles below them (literally below them, including in the basement).
The recurring motif of ""the smell""... This intangible and undeniable characteristic clings to the Kims, a constant reminder of their poverty that the Parks find vaguely offensive, without even knowing exactly why. It's a powerful symbol of how deeply ingrained class distinctions are in the film, extending beyond the material to the very essence of each person.
While the Kims undeniably infiltrate the Park household with deceptive intent, the film questions who truly benefits and who is ""parasitic"" in this societal structure. The Parks, for all their wealth, are depicted as helpless and reliant on the labor of others to maintain their existence. Their ""niceness"" is a byproduct of their comfort and ease, rather than an inherent virtue. The film also includes of course another layer of hidden ""parasites"" within the Park house, further complicating the notion of who is exploiting whom.
This film is a showcase the consequences when distinct worlds collide, revealing a fragility in the social boundaries. Simmering resentments erupt into chaos in the face of wealth inequality and the societal structures that perpetuate it. Social mobility is an illusion, and crossing class lines has repercussions."

Rich vs Poor
When looking at the lives of the poor, rich people would only feel pity, maybe show a little compassion but they would not understand it. They can bestow favors to the needy by compensating them for their services and saying a few words of encouragement to make the less fortunate feel better. The rich can only do so much. Let‚Äôs just say you go downtown and you give a beggar that you spot scrounging on the pavement a few pennies as a way to express sympathy for their hardship but you do not understand what it is like having to beg for money to live. No matter how generous the rich may be, the gap between them and the poor can never be abridged but instead widens as time goes on. Mr. Park has drawn an invisible line for himself so that he could establish spatial awareness between him and his employee - ""we're paying you overtime, so think of it as part of your work"" - and in the meantime building a hierarchal structure that separates him and his family, the 1%, from the rest. However, the parasite(s) do not get this because they forever need a host to latch onto. So once their spaces become overlapped, things are only going to get uglier and violence is bound to happen. It‚Äôs inevitable. It‚Äôs inescapable. Even if the Kims didn‚Äôt set their feet over the line, their smells would eventually find a way to cross over to the Parks and the Parks comments would also find their way back to the Kims.
Poor vs Poor
Money is everything. Money can change a person. Money can iron out all the creases. If you had money, you‚Äôd be kinder. Money is what we fight for despite knowing that it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. It pits the needy against each other in a game of survival. So when Mrs. Kim compares her husband to a cockroach that scampers away whenever the owner switches on the lights, she pares the sad truth to its bone. The reaction of Mr. Kim when he hears this remark is genuine and his anger begins to take shape - Anger rubbed off, reddened by shame and so when he says, ‚ÄúI fooled you didn't I?‚Äù while the other family members try to laugh it off only further proves the point. The conflict that later arises between them and the other poor family (basement dwellers) in the second half of the film is like a tug of war between rats and roaches. Since these two sides are both standing on the same bottom rung of the hierarchy, there is still a sense of sympathy residing among these people, and unlike the rich, this level of sympathy developed because of their mutual understanding of the opposite party. They are all the same, badly off, rotten in the ground with the subway smells obstinately clinging onto their clothes, their flesh. I've fallen head over heels with how Bong portrayed poverty, but I wondered if the movie managed to emotionally affect the 1 percenters who have seen the film as hard as it hit the other 99% - Rich people may flash a little compassion at the poor, but they can never understand them.

2025-01-29,5.0,"First non English film I‚Äôve given 5 stars to. First time I watched this I thought it was pretty decent. This time I thought it was unbelievable. 2 reasons mainly this film is so good. 
It‚Äôs an unbelievable thriller, even on a re watch I was shitting myself for most of it, but that may of been the coffee. Making this so entertaining to watch as the time flies by. 
The commentary on social classes it‚Äôs truly remarkable, it isn‚Äôt your classic rich vs poor, rich bad and poor good film. The poor fight each other in order to stay the parasite, so they‚Äôre able to live. The symbolism with the stairs is everywhere. The Kim family are still higher than the 2 in the basement, and when the dad is compared with the man from the basement he does what he does. The rich family aren‚Äôt evil but are oblivious to the lower levels. When the storm hits and people lose their homes and they don‚Äôt even care for their workers, sacking so many then when the family starts to get stabbed they don‚Äôt care about them. At the end the realisation that they can only dream about having that house, and for the dad to come up the stairs to another level."

Parasita √© uma obra inusitadamente brilhante que mistura com√©dia, drama e suspense para abordar as desigualdades sociais. A hist√≥ria acompanha a fam√≠lia Kim, que se infiltra na rica casa dos Park, revelando a disparidade entre classes sociais de forma brilhante e subversiva.

üá∫üá≤A profound, intelligent and moving social critique.
Parasite is an unusually brilliant work that mixes comedy, drama and suspense to address social inequalities. The story follows the Kim family, who infiltrate the wealthy Park household, revealing the disparity between social classes in a brilliant and subversive way. Bong Joon-ho's direction uses the two families' homes as powerful metaphors, and the photography and production design are exceptional. The performances are impeccable, especially Song Kang-ho, who brings a complex humanity to his character.
In addition, there is a disturbing way of filming that never veers into vulgar provocation: The spectacular rain for the bosses is a flood for the servants. The sophisticated spaces are large, contrasting with the smallness of the cubicles of the peripheral ones. The boss imports North American products, the fired housekeeper does a cheap imitation of a North Korean TV presenter.
The final part is brilliant, in a cadence of surprising scenes. For those who appreciate well-made cinema, this is a gem to be treasured.
Parasite is a fierce and engaging critique of modern society, challenging the viewer to reflect"

It‚Äôs such a beautifully shot and expertly written movie, tight and perfectly orchestrated by a man who‚Äôs a master of his craft. It‚Äôs just, sadly, Bong‚Äôs made much better movies.

2025-02-07,5.0,"‚ÄúKi-woo, you know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. No plan. You know why? If you make a plan, life never works out that way.‚Äù
Out of my Letterboxd Top 4, I‚Äôve talked extensively and passionately about The Big Lebowski, Punch Drunk-Love, and Moonlight multiple times, but I never once really had the opportunity to talk about this movie and how much it means to me. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve been trying to avoid it, but rather I just really wanted to save this movie for a special occasion or moment that felt appropriate to me, as I do with all of the films that are on my Top 100 or Honorable Mentions. So when I heard that this and Moonlight (that review will happen near the end of the month when I go see it) were both getting rereleased in IMAX, I immediately bought the tickets for both the second they became available, and I can confidently say that this was the perfect time for me to review this.
Parasite was not just my introduction to Bong Joon-ho and Korean cinema in general; it was my introduction to world cinema as a whole. I owe this film so much love and thanks for being the gateway to an entire cavalcade of art that I could explore, love, and appreciate, and I owe it for giving me some of my favorite filmmakers of all time, such as Akira Kurosawa, Satoshi Kon, Park Chan-wook, and Wong Kar-Wai. In addition to all of those, Bong Joon-ho himself is without question in my top 10 filmmakers of all time. His filmography (at least from what I‚Äôve seen so far) is one of the best there ever is, with other films such as Memories of Murder and The Host all being some of my favorite movies.
Bong Joon-ho is such a genius when it comes to capturing suspense and tension in film in a way that would leave someone like Alfred Hitchcock teary-eyed with joy. His unending ability to so perfectly portray empathy and understanding from characters who, on the surface, are very flawed in many ways; his ability to put great emphasis and purpose on objects that carry throughout the entire duration of his films; his ability to meticulously craft stories that are intense, heartfelt, unnerving, emotional, passionate, beautiful, and, in some instances, funny; and his ability to, while at the same time, implement some of the most important, relevant, and personal themes you will ever come across in a film truly speak to how loving and passionate of a filmmaker he is.
Parasite is a film that incorporates all of those aspects, but I think they‚Äôre all done at their absolute best. This film, without question, is so deserving of all the Oscars it won, of being so highly rated on both the Letterboxd and IMDB Top 250, and of being called one of the greatest films of both the 21st century and of all time.
The movie's themes of economic disparity, poverty, family, deception, jealousy, greed, ignorance, prosperity, loss, wealth, violence, status, and inequality are truly inspirational and a sight to behold when taken from the pen to the screen. Not a single second or moment is wasted on capturing the glaring differences between the Kim family and the Park family, as well as showing off the constant back-and-forth struggles the two families have throughout the film. Parasite also uses a lot of clever symbols and analogies throughout its runtime to even further its themes with things such as ram-don, the sense of smell, a unique stone, and peaches.
The cinematography, set designs, and score are some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any film, with their ability to transport you so effortlessly and help carry through every single emotion with the snap of a finger. One moment you will be laughing along with, and then the next moment you will be sitting there fucking shocked and mortified, and then you‚Äôll be left feeling bittersweet and teary-eyed. I will genuinely never forget my first time watching this, as there were moments where my jaw went through the fucking floor. That scene with Moon-gwang (the housekeeper) looking into the camera in the rain and smiling will always stay with me in my mind forever, as well as the image of the man in the stairs (which, if you know, you know).
The performances in this are all perfect, and each cast member deserves as much love, praise, and flowers as they could possibly get, and especially Song Kang-ho in particular. It honestly makes me so sad now that he didn‚Äôt win an Oscar for this performance or was even nominated at all. He truly has become for me one of my favorite actors of all time, and he‚Äôs one of the only few where I will watch a movie solely because he is in it. In this movie, the other Bong Joon-ho films he‚Äôs in, as well as another all-time favorite film of mine called A Taxi Driver, he‚Äôs just so damn effective at giving you characters with raw, guttural emotion, whether it‚Äôs portrayed more loudly and sporadically or more quietly and subdued. I feel like he gets so overlooked and unappreciated when it comes to the best actors to do it.
But essentially, yes, this, to me, is just such a perfect film, and like with the other three in my Letterboxd Top 4, as well as with my many films in my Top 100 in general, it changed my life and my perspective as a filmmaker and film lover forever, and I will always be indebted to it. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho

2019-11-03,5.0,"I was given great advice about Parasite: ""read nothing, go in blind, trust Joon-ho Bong."" You should follow that advice too and just go see it.
If you wants some further thoughts on it, here's what I'll share. Parasite is a brilliant interplay of scathing social commentary, horrific violence, uproarious humor, and trenchant character drama. I'm almost at a loss to describe the film. It feels as though the best elements of Shoplifters, Burning, The Dinner Game, Ready or Not, and every heist movie ever were tossed into a blender and sprinkled liberally with doses of black humor. Joon-ho Bong is a truly a mad craftsman here at the very height of his power.
The cast is uniformly strongly and, most compelling, even the most apparently revolting characters are humanized in key ways. The theatrical translation is witty and excellent. There's a ton to unpack here - the sort of stuff best held for serious film criticism and not quick reviews and rankings. Parasite is one of the very best films of the year.

I believe it is more conducive to go into this blind, so I'll keep this review short. Bong Joon-ho has managed to capture all the complexity of our present moment in time and spit it back out at us in multidimensional form. It all flew by so quickly, that as soon as it ended, I just wanted to experience the whole thing over again. There have been so many extraordinary films to drop this year, but Parasite deserves the most buzz. If you only go out to the theater once this year, make it this one."
2019-08-10,4.5,"Believe the hype. PARASITE is a masterpiece on so many levels. It is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror, a social satire and has a deep socio-economic statement that's timely.

2025-02-26,4.5,"""you know what kind of plan never fails? no plan. no plan at all. you know why? because life cannot be planned.""

there's no other director who nails social commentary quite like bong joon ho does. i only watched parasite once before, back when it swept the oscars, but i had to revisit it. with my mom this time, who had no idea what to expect. i wanted to see her reaction to what i consider one of the most reflective movies ever made.
snowpiercer (which definitely deserves a rewatch and proper rating from me) and okja are films i keep thinking about. while i'm eagerly awaiting mickey 17, i finally gave parasite a long-overdue rewatch.
but why exactly was the title so significant and what made the movie so trenchant?
parasite was a careful exploration of parasitism, both literally and metaphorically. by contrasting the wealthy park family with the impoverished kim family, the film depicted how the latter slowly infiltrated the parks' lives, using deception and manipulation as tools for survival.
the title reflected the kims' parasitic dependency on the parks, not just for financial support but also for shelter. a relationship that metaphorically mirrored the way social classes in society often rely on each other for their own survival.
both the rich and the poor were shown to be trapped in a system of mutual dependence, feeding off each other in different ways, while maintaining an inherent imbalance of power.
the film's storytelling was, without question, one of its greatest strengths. the script was written so precisely and meticulously that new details emerge with every viewing.
i loved how the story began with a sunny, almost whimsical tone. despite being a family haunted by bad luck, the kims still clung to hope.
when the opportunity arose, they seized it with remarkable cunning, all while completely immersed in the sudden windfall of their circumstances.
the script did an exceptional job of establishing a foundation that invested you in every character's personal journey. by the time the film hit the one-hour mark, you were fully engaged in each person's arc, making the tonal shift halfway through all the more effective in reenergizing the plot.
not one moment of the film felt boring. every scene, every action and every line of dialogue gripped your attention.
upon rewatching, i was particularly fascinated by the rock.
a seemingly innocuous gift that was thrust upon the kims. it was described as a symbol of fortune, yet by the end of the movie, it turned out to be nothing more than what it was: just a rock.
still, it carried an undeniable weight - both literally and figuratively. initially a gift, it became a heavy burden, perhaps even representing the oppressive weight of the social structure itself.
parasite delved into the topic of social class with an astuteness that avoided the pretentiousness often found in films tackling similar themes. it subtly but powerfully highlighted how one's wealth could literally, though tragically, satisfy another's hunger.
bong joon ho didn't just emphasize the class distinctions through dialogue and plot but also through his masterful use of the camera. he cleverly highlighted and concealed characters and objects, using levels to depict the social class pyramid. this visual approach became a profound commentary on the structures that kept people in their respective places and it forced viewers to reflect on their own position within this hierarchy.
what makes parasite so fascinating is that each viewer takes something different from it. while it may be a dark comedy-thriller at its surface, at its core, the film challenges you to reflect on your own beliefs and assumptions about class. it's a personal experience for everyone. my mom, for example, had a perspective on the film that i hadn't even considered.
bong joon ho, with every one of his projects, invites viewers to watch with their own eyes and then engage in meaningful conversations afterward, sparking a chain of reflection.
social commentary can be one of the most difficult aspects of filmmaking but bong joon ho effortlessly delivers in a poignant message that resonates deeply and stays with you long after the credits roll."
2023-05-03,5.0,"""Voc√™ sabe que tipo de plano nunca falha?Nenhum plano‚Ä¶ voc√™ sabe por qu√™? Porque a vida n√£o pode ser planejada""
Meus amigos, o que eu acabei de assistir n√£o foi coisa que n√£o se preze n√£o vius. Nossa sim, √© ver√≠dico o que 99% das pessoas que conferiram Parasita afirmam: o filme √© uma obra prima inigual√°vel de Bong Joon-ho e me arrisco a dizer que √© um dos maiores do cinema mundial. Este √© um longa que n√£o enrola e vai direto ao ponto, explora todo o seu potencial e entrega uma qualidade e originalidade absurdas, jamais vistas ou n√£o t√£o exploradas em muitos filmes da atualidade. O filme desenvolve sem rodeios, logo de cara a desigualdade social trazida pela influ√™ncia do capitalismo na Coreia do Sul, aonde vemos com clareza, a situa√ß√£o tr√°gica e ca√≥tica de quem reside nas periferias das cidades do pa√≠s. Acompanhamos uma fam√≠lia pobre que vive em uma dessas periferias e que sobrevive a partir da intelig√™ncia que se sobressae por cima da ingenuidade e burrice de uma fam√≠lia rica. Pode ser uma premissa meio sem gra√ßa e j√° usada algumas vezes, por√©m o Jong-ho transforma isso em algo gigante e extraordin√°rio que confunde sua cabe√ßa em alguns momentos, aonde o espectador fica ao certo sem saber quem de fato √© o parasita ali, se √© a fam√≠lia pobre ou a fam√≠lia rica.  O background de todos os personagens √© cuidadosamente crescente ao decorrer das 2h12min de Parasita, isso √© tempo o suficiente para o Jong-ho se atentar com e desenrolar da hist√≥ria com a ajuda de um roteiro super coesivo e, para utilizar-se desses mesmos mecanismos para desenvolver todos aqueles que ficam entorno da hist√≥ria. O que mais me chamou aten√ß√£o nos persongens foi a imprevisibilidade deles, que a cada cena em que eles est√£o, tudo meio que vai se esclarecendo ou acabando confundindo ainda mais quem est√° assistindo, devido a grande surpresas que Jong-ho deve est√° privando a n√≥s. Parasita √© um filme criado claramente para expor a separa√ß√£o entre classes, poiso filme passa uma mensagem muito importante sobre as diferen√ßas entre pobres e ricos e tamb√©m, uma reflex√£o sobre a fam√≠lia rica tamb√©m ser parasita, mesmo que de uma forma diferente. Entretanto, n√£o consigo ver dessa forma, pois mesmo considerando que passa realmente uma mensagem subjetiva, n√£o d√° para relativizar atitudes totalmente inescrupulosas por parte da fam√≠lia pobre, assim como n√£o d√° pra fingir que a fam√≠lia rica tamb√©m fazia tudo certo‚Ä¶ Acho que Bong Jong-ho tamb√©m pensaria assim‚Ä¶"

Granted, I knew Bong would do his usual genre blending, but the fact he did his usual critique of the class differences in South Korea while also making me bust a gut? That's some huge skill right there. Stellar acting overall, but I just have to give it to Park So-dam. Her character was probably the most frustrating yet compelling. Ki-jung proves to be very cunning throughout the story, setting up most of the plans to kick the other employees out. Yet, she's too lazy to even THINK of what her dream home would be like. While I should watch it again to really let it sink in, I don't think anything else from 2019 will top this for me."
2019-10-11,5.0,"This is the most ‚Äúnon-boring‚Äù movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Like, how is it possible for somebody to not find this entertaining? HOW?
In 2013, acclaimed South Korean director Bong Joon-ho released his science-fiction thriller Snowpiercer‚Äîa SEVERELY underrated wonder that used a never-ending train as a metaphorical abstraction of a social ladder. It was an event that employed its post-apocalyptic setting, a world where it was nearly too damn cold for people to thrive on, to show that, no matter the situation, hierarchy would always remain relevant among humans. All though, these implications were important for the very subjects the film was cold-bloodedly judging (people), they were arguably patent. The picture came off as fairly surface-leveled commentary. It was as if the film was a warm-up for what was to come six years down the road‚Ä¶
Parasite is essentially Joon-ho taking on this theme of ‚Äúclass‚Äù for a second batting. This time around, however, the memo feels more obscured by the dim and contrasting ideologies of its fluctuating characters. The movie sets out to explore its title (Parasite) to the fullest degree, paralleling the poor life to a set of anguished insects but using the rich personas as the guilty initiators of the infectious swarm.
From themes of intelligence over riches to ego vs. priorities, Parasite contrives to say so much without feeling overly preachy‚Äîwhich is a tricky maneuver to pull off. It‚Äôs a duel, full-course meal that lets you enjoy while simultaneously letting you suffer in the most inconceivably menacing approach imaginable. Through a three-act structure like no other, each act invokes a new theme, a new idea, all surrounding the central concept of social status. But most fatally, each segment conducts divergent tones, ultimately stirring a sufficient blend of mixed emotions and further creating the psychological detriments that Parasite delivers so devilishly to its audience.
Parasite is a checklist for a masterpiece, honestly. Stainless casting? Check. Cinematography that‚Äôll make your insides riddle with anticipation. Check. One of the shrewdest scripts of ALL-TIME. Check. Holy original Bong Joon-ho execution? Check. Somehow, a film made by one of South Korea‚Äôs greatest directors of all-time found a way to surpass expectations. It‚Äôs a baffling, cinematic affair if I‚Äôd ever seen one.
Parasite manages to be the funniest, darkest, and the most persuasive film of 2019, thus far. It‚Äôs a theater experience like no other, that leads you in about five different directions, with five different presumptions, until it becomes so uncontrollably maddening that it leaches through the viewers‚Äô bodies like a dirty, pesky bug. It‚Äôs game-changing, frankly. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a movie quite as riveting as Parasite in years.

2025-03-24,5.0,"Solo vi esta pelicula una sola vez hasta ahora y fue el mismo a√±o en que se estreno y solo recordaba peque√±os pedazos de la historia, pero no recordaba bien el final asi que decidi volver a verla despu√©s de tanto y es sin duda uno de los mejores thrillers que hay, bien merecido el oscar.
El trabajo de Bong Joon-ho en este filme es maravilloso.
La trama se centra en dos familias de diferentes est√°ndares econ√≥micos: los Kim que viven en la pobreza y los Park que viven en la riqueza. Es una cr√≠tica a las desigualdades sociales de clase, te muestra como conviven y contrastan los ricos de los pobres, a trav√©s de una narrativa que mezcla el drama, la comedia negra y el thriller.
La habilidad de Bong Joon-ho para contar una historia compleja y con giros inesperados, manteniendo al espectador con tensi√≥n en todo momento es admirable.
Las actuaciones de las dos familias protagonistas son un espect√°culo, el como transmiten esa autenticidad y esa profundidad emocional. Hasta los perros actuaron bien üòù
La hermosa cinematograf√≠a y el dise√±o de producci√≥n son destacables, con elementos que enriquecen la narrativa con detalles que refuerzan los temas de la pel√≠cula.
En resumen, Parasite es una obra maestra
moderna que logra unir entretenimiento con una cr√≠tica social profunda. Su √©xito es m√°s que merecido elevando la carrera de Bong Joon-ho y la visibilidad del cine surcoreano a nivel mundial. Super recomendada aunque tal vez todo el mundo ya la vio."

2019-08-27,4.5,"Don‚Äôt watch any of the trailers and don‚Äôt read anything about it before watching it. Considering that, I‚Äôll try to be as vague as possible in this review.
I haven‚Äôt seen a film like this in a long time. It was fascinating to watch how the film was unexpectedly unraveling whilst juggling many different genres and many different characters. That‚Äôs always a risky thing to do. Many films fail while trying to be many different genres at once, but this film pulled it off perfectly. I won‚Äôt go too much into details, just watch it for yourself and enjoy it.
This was the best-directed film of the year without any questions. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Bong Joon-Ho (although I‚Äôve only seen his two American films) but this film was a masterclass in directing, and I truly hope he‚Äôll get an Oscar nomination. His shot selection was excellent, and he always managed to pull out most out of a cadre. Suspense sequences were extremely suspense because of the way he framed them, same goes for dramatic and comedic sequences. Furthermore, the blocking was excellent. Whenever you have more than a few people at one place, you get a great sense of space and who is placed where. Usage of space, in general, was perfect, and he always pulled out the maximum from filming locations. Every shot of his tells some story. E.g. (maybe small spoilers) when certain characters are returning back to home at rainy night, you can see a great comparison and beautiful transition from higher class to lower class just from looking at his shot selection. He delivers a message of the film and he tells us what‚Äôs a film about just from framing the sequence.
Furthermore, he pulled out fantastic performances from every actor. The film balances a very thin line with the main family. They could‚Äôve been unlikable characters very easily, but because of their performances, they managed to successfully walk on that tiny line.
I only have one issue with this film. I felt the ending of the film was detached from the rest of the film. The end itself didn‚Äôt have as strong punch as it could‚Äôve, and I would say the film should‚Äôve ended 5-10 minutes earlier. Whilst watching it, it felt like a short film added to a feature film. Maybe that won‚Äôt be an issue on a rewatch, but looking at it right now, that‚Äôs my only gripe with it.
In the end, this is a huge recommendation from me, especially if you don‚Äôt know anything about the film. That way, you‚Äôll be on an extremely wild ride with it."
2019-08-16,4.5,Bong Joon-ho and Luca Guadagnino really know how to do fucked up things with peaches.
2023-09-17,5.0,"The greatest movie ever made? It's certainly up there. Words can't express how good this film is. Every single second of this film is perfect, Bony Joon Ho executed every aspect flawlessly. It was bound to happen but Prisoners leaves my top ten favourites for the first time this year.
This film puts me through all sorts of emotions and makes my heart race like no other. The way the film blends so many themes and genres together is just genius. Not only is it a drama thriller but it also tackles such deep themes of class conflict and wealth inequality. The twists and turns are just crazy, and everytime I watch the ending, it gets me super shocked.
The performances from the whole cast are truly amazing, some of the greatest display of acting I've ever seen. The cinematography perfectly shows the rundown, gritty poverty juxtaposing it against the stunning and easy rich life. I honestly dont believe there is a single shot wasted throughout its entire runtime and it's got to be in the conversation with having the greatest cinematography ever.
Overall, Parasite in my opinion is one of the greatest movies ever made and easily gets a near perfect score from me. An absolute must watch and one that gets better on every watch, due to the immense detail put through the props and writing, aswell as the incredible use of foreshadowing.

2023-04-14,5.0,"The Parasitic master Bong Joon-ho: Ranked!
""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""
Bong Joon-ho always knows how to crush our spirits with his endings, doesn't he? He didn't even bother to put the line above at the ending, he'd much rather let us think ""oh yes there's a chance - no matter how small - that his plan to buy the house will work"" but then you remember the placement of the line I've put above earlier in the film...
I'm going to refrain from writing my usual kind of reviews because well, what's the point with this film? So instead I'm going to attempt to sound clever and try to decipher the little that I can from this film made by no mere mortal like me. So this review might be a bit jumbled and hell I might even get the complete wrong idea with some things but let's see what I can come up with.
When such a rigid class structure is present in society, you've got those less fortunate fending for themselves and those with the most having the wealth to be nice to people (although only those who they actually see). While the Park's enjoy their time camping - in others words, disconnected and out of touch from society - the Kim family (the working class who become forced to turn to criminality) and the husband and wife who are literally and metaphorically trapped in the Park's lives and their house, are left to fight over the quality of their lives deep down below the lavish house above. The cause of all the fighting in the first place - the trapped husband - is a result of the obliviousness of the upper class Park family, who also lack the knowledge of the lower class who have the ingenuity to see morse code. And on top of that, the main reason for the hiding of the secret basement is because the last owner was so embarrassed to look cowardly and weak to have this hiding place that he sealed it up and didn't mention it again. But what he leaves behind as a rich man is left for the working class to benefit off, and so we find Geun-se and Moon-gwang in the situation that they are in. Geun-se is only able to be in the (at first) fortunate position he is in because of what the rich architect left behind. Also, to be able to get into the Park's rich lifestyle in the first place, Ki-woo had to be recommended by his upper class friend Min, because it simply isn't possible for any mingling to randomly happen between the working class and upper classes; the upper classes have to approve of the lower class before allowing any interaction.
Another example of the ingenious wit in this film is the title. It would seem obvious that it refers to the Kim family, who are living off of the Park's gullibility, wouldn't it? But if like me you are an absolute genius...
You can see that it could also, and much more fittingly, refer to the rich. They hire all these workers for them because they would be incapable of living the life they want without them. They would have to live off the ""awful"" cooking of Mrs. Park, and when would they be able to do any house work if Mr. Park is always so busy and Mrs. Park is useless at it? They can't live their lives as they do without the work of the working class Kims, so in short, they too can be seen as parasites.
Yes I'm still going on, but I also noticed the irony of Ki-woo being bludgeoned by the stone that was said to help bring materialistic wealth to him. Once he gains that though, it comes back to hit him. The timing of the stone and the sudden employment of Ki-woo shows that the stone may have proved its worth as it does seem to have brought material wealth, however the irony is that it also helps to bring about the end to it. Also, while the arrival of the stone is played for laughs (it being so ""metaphorical"" and the mother saying that ""food would have been better"" in such a matter of fact way), I think it represents another thing - how out of touch the rich can be. Rather than being genuinely helpful Min's grandfather decided it is of utmost importance to deliver a useless token; a mere collectible, that even happens to ruin Ki-woo's plan at the end. Also I just love how Bong Joon-ho gets comedy out of the characters being in awe of how ""metaphorical"" the rock is and yet it actually is a metaphor that Joon-ho has created.
On this second viewing I found it impossible to stay relaxed (I found it hard to even laugh at the comedy this time). The first viewing was nice, funny and calm until THAT tonal shift (which may be the best shift in tone in all of cinema) after which I was in a disturbed state for the rest of the film, because it was so unexpected. This time however I found it impossible to be at ease at all because I knew what was coming up. Rewatching this now I realise that what Bong Joon-ho is trying to say is that this tumbling of society is inevitable and that it's pretty obvious that it's going to happen when you look deeper into society, because it's just constantly uncomfortable viewing this time around. Just look at the French Revolution, once you look back and see that the cause of such a violent outburst was because of such a rigid class system then it becomes clear that in these kinds of systems in the world it's just a suspenseful waiting game of when it will happen again if things don't change. Honestly it almost turns into a horror film once that basement is discovered - and what a tracking shot and frightening score to introduce it with, watching Chung-sook frantically descend into it is truly horrifying.
I hope you all don't mind the length of this (as this is by far my lengthiest review), sometimes I start writing and then lose track of how much I write, and then don't know what to get rid of. If I've got any of this right it's probably been said before but that just speaks to the brilliance of Parasite, it's just so ripe for exploring.
Anyway, 5 stars, although I was tempted to put it at 4.5 because the start feels a little too slow but I decided not to.
5 stars == Basically perfect.
Next I'm planning to soon finish rewatching the Johnny English films, watch the other two Bourne films, and I'm also planning to add Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher films to my Bourne Vs Wick list as well. And after enjoying going through the films of Bong Joon-ho so much I've decided to start going through another director's filmography soon - hint: he is Japanese."

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
I directed to rewatch ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô for the 1 year celebration honour of their Oscar winning night. The night where they came and then they conquered. Winning the holy grail that is best picture.
The whole metaphor of the film is success and fortune are only reserved for those who deserves it whilst other people not in that position tries to climb onto the ladder doesn‚Äôt just refer to South Korea, Bong refers to the entire world. The widening gap of the rich and the poor. What he also shows us how both people of the scale lives, how they deal with social and financial issues. Bong plays with us, he makes a guessing game of which family in the film is actually the most rotten, the family that‚Äôs cunning who live in a basement, or the polar opposite family. The extents we go to have the best lives we can possibly have.
This fully deserves the nominations it got and it fully deserves the wins it achieved. I can‚Äôt find a single fault with this film. And that‚Äôs a hard task to achieve. This is one in a few movies that doesn‚Äôt have any faults. Every shot is framed perfectly, it‚Äôs shot beautifully (it even looks more beautiful in B&W), the editing doesn‚Äôt miss a beat everything is edited on point. That helps the pace go unbelievable quick. Even with the plot twist that happens towards the end, the film makes you feel like there is some tension somewhere.
The only thing I would say is that, I wish the actors got some recognition at the Oscars. Especially Kang-ho Song as Ki (the father of the poor family) I just hoped the academy nominated him or anyone in the film. Shame that didn‚Äôt happen.
Bong has crafted a masterpiece that won‚Äôt be topped in its craftsmanship, filmmaking, praise, metaphorical messages. The way this film has impacted hundreds of thousands of people. The way it has left its footprint on films. The way it impacted awards season. A film without faults. A film that only comes once in a lifetime. ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô will never be topped.

i'm struggling to think of words that i could say about parasite that haven't already been said. there was so much to grasp that i think multiple watches are inevitable for this film. but wow, bong joon-ho is really a master, isn't he?
there were a myriad of themes that struck me in this piece: grief, loss, greed, desperation, classism, hardship, familial obligation, condescension, distance, loneliness, emptiness, hunger (literal and figurative), just to name a few. but what sticks with me the most, at least on my first watch (yes, i really haven't seen this until now somehow), is the theme of humiliation. the loss of dignity, the stripping of one's self-esteem. most of what occurs in this film, especially in the third act, can be pulled from this underlying source. those who dish out shame are perishable, just like the ones they embarrass. no one is above anyone else. that's an important lesson that bong joon-ho is trying to convey here.
perhaps the smell of a basement *is* like an ""old radish""; perhaps it's putrid, lingering, a foul stench upon the nostrils. but the far more lasting odor is the rotten aroma of pride. vanity can be a disease that eats you from the inside out. what do any one of us have left at the end of the day besides ourselves? who we are? or, maybe a more important question: who are we? parasite is asking you to choose what kind of person you want to be, and it's asking you to live by that, to live *up* to that. will you?

It is pretty amazing that Bong Joon-ho was able to make a film where practically every scene or even prop can have some meaning that relates to Parasites or siphoning off of another. When I first saw the trailer and saw Song Kang-ho in a Native American Headdress I was a little taken aback. But the execution of the ideas, that these rich people will siphon off of everything, whether its poor people or disenfranchised cultures all the way across the world just to make their son happy, without properly taking the time to understand that culture is pretty brilliant. I noticed a lot more subtlety with that specific example this time around.
Another I paid more attention to is how beautiful the soundtrack is. Whether its the composed score or the few times they play licensed songs, it doesn't just compliment the scene, its fully ingrained in everything the scene is. The beauty of the films made by Bong Joon-ho is that if you take even a tiny piece out of one of the scenes, it might completely fall apart. It might still be a good scene for a regular film, but Bong Joon-ho films ascend to a higher plane, where every piece works perfectly in sync 100% of the time.
Just like all of his other films, the comedy to horror is able to flip back and forth effortlessly, having some truly intense and brutal scenes, filled with dread, but then jump to the next scene where it is full of jokes and laughs and Song Kang-ho's beautiful face. The performances definitely make the execution of this much easier. Song Kang-ho is probably my favorite performance, but Lee Jung-eun as Moon-gwang, Choi Woo-shik as Ki-woo, and Park So-dam as Ki-jung were all close behind as well. Everyone else was brilliant as well. This is one of the most beautiful and well acted films I have ever seen, and the absolute craziest part about that is I don't even think it is the best Bong Joon-ho film."
2019-06-29,2.0,"class consciousness in the 2010s deserves a lucid and incisive critique of capital and the way it warps our minds, and this trite 'Us'-level allegory ain't it, fam.
more complete review forthcoming if i get more mad about how bad this was in the next few days

(a few days pass)

i think i've figured out why i didn't love this film. while it's good, and i'm glad it exists, it's not a particularly well done or well communicated allegory. walking out of the cinema with a few friends and talking, the only salient insight i could glean was ""damn class really do be like that tho""
the fact that the lower class family treats every other worker in their position as a competitor, and ultimately dispensible in their quest for more is an insightful point, and an interesting indictment on neolib capitalism.
however, the rest of this film falls back on very traditional and basic conceptions of class antagonism, to the point where the climax of the film hinges on a cartoonish ""P.U! poor ppl smell bad lol"" plot point. very few people actually act that way, and i am far more interested in the ways those attitudes are incubated, enabled and obscured by capital. 
that goes to another gripe of mine: these characters are caricatures, and i didn't feel anything for them. there may be a level of intent behind that but it is lost on the fact that Parasite didn't say anything more substantial than ""we live in a society"", or if it tried to, it was unsuccessful.

all of these gripes flow on to the major issue i have with this film: for all of its focus on class, Parasite does not pick sides between either family or class, to the point that, in my eyes, it fails to say almost anything useful to me. the rich family are kind of vapid idiots, but the poor family are the ones that do all of the damage and the morally reprehensible things in this film. again, i get that this cannibalisation of the worker class is an interesting point, but it is not enough to sustain the appeal of this movie for me.
i'm sticking with my original negative rating even though i've warmed to this film a little in recent days purely because for all of the hype about this film's political appeal, it was a fucking disappointment.
if you want a more incisive look at class in a modern South Korean context watch Burning instead."

I'm not sure that there is anyone working today that is creating such entertaining, beautiful and socially engaged films as Joon-Ho Bong. As far as English-language films go, maybe Jordan Peele could claim a similar stature if he continues to develop a strong body of work going forward. However, there will be nothing quite like a hit from the Bong. This dude makes massive movies that work on so many levels. The judges at Cannes done did good this year when they awarded it the palme d'dor.

Bong Joon Ho seriously writes and directs the most compelling films, and he is completely gripping with the way he wrote this and how it teeters the line but is completely undeniable with its sharp bite and wit. 
This is incredibly paced and structured and getting to rewatch it after a couple years in a packed IMAX theater was brilliant. I‚Äôve never felt more alive.
Bong you are the GOAT. Nothing will ever top you for me. You deserve all your accolades and MORE.
The way Bong touches all genres and creates such a specific to him directing style is incredible. I started reading Mickey7 not that long ago and I absolutely cannot wait to see his spin on that story, as it feels the most similar to his film Snowpiercer I‚Äôm sure it will be amazing.
Parasite is a deeply impactful narrative, sets boundaries between these classes both figuratively and visually. Getting straight to the point each and everytime and there are so many subtleties that later have such a huge impact to the plot and the overarching theme in its entirety. This is a FEAT of filmmaking and it will be hard to top this for years to come. Incredible performances all around and deserve way more commercial praise!! 
This type of movie makes me feel ALIVE."

2022-08-04,5.0,"I was way too overly harsh the first time I watched this movie. I am glad I gave it a re-watch, though. I am still not as high on this film as the vast majority of the population, but it still is quite brilliant.
The first half of this movie is a cunning comedy with themes of classism in what is truly just a perfect and brilliant first hour of the film.
In the second half, things take a dark twist -- severely dark. The classist divides grow deeper and the characters' desperations and frustrations grow tenser as the film's tone shifts to a full-on thriller.
The ending of this movie still loses me a bit. The infiltrating family shows us they are brilliantly clever, incredibly deceptive, have extremely high IQ when it comes to people manipulation, and ultimately of the highest class of street skills yet many of the decisions they make that lead to their demise are bone-headed, dumb, and easily avoidable by people with the wit of their family.
Initially, I had wished the movie cut to the credits and ended at the culmination of the backyard murders as seeing Ki-woo alive with brain damage initially caused an eye-roll, but the morse code letter from his father and his fantasies of purchasing the home being brought back to reality by their crippling debt was a poignant exclamation point on the themes of this film.
The backyard murders provided shock value, albeit relatively expected to happen.
In summary, the first half of the film was perfect, and the very end was very moving, but the backyard murder scene and the events leading up to it lose me a bit; however, I must say this film grows on me more and more with age."

If I haven't mentioned it before, Bong Joon-ho is my favorite director. And this movie blew me away. Equal parts funny and thrilling, while also adding a family dynamic that is surprisingly endearing, Joon-ho crafts a film that successfully wanders through the turmoil of financial inequality.
The performances are all brilliant, but I HAVE to talk about my favorite actor, the legendary Song Kang-ho. His character has a innate coolness to him, shown off from his driving scenes to his immediate jump to action to help to family, and even at the very beginning as he begins to rapidly fold pizza boxes. I loved watching this family plot things together, because even as more sinister things began to happen, the treatment of each other remained the same.
Joon-ho successfully adds more mistakes to his characters that just nail in the facts that they are human, or they are compassionate. Much like the mistakes of the main character in The Host, all of the mistakes our main characters make in this film can be summed up to very understandable mistakes, and that helps to drive it up on the scale of films as well.
There were some brilliant shots as well, but I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't get to spend as much time taking in the shots and lighting as much as I would like to. So I am extremely looking forward to my rewatch to what is currently my top film of the year."

Parasita continua t√£o bom quanto me lembrava. A forma como Bong Joon-ho usa da arquitetura no filme, especialmente na maneira de tra√ßar linhas e espa√ßos, maximizando a ideia de estratifica√ß√£o social, √© muito interessante.

At√© mesmo os di√°logos expositivos que existem no filme n√£o perdem seu impacto. Vide anos depois ainda h√° quem lembre da cena do carro.
√â um filme que entende bem os c√≥digos norte-americanos (como boa parte do cinema sul-coreano atual), e faz algo de interessante com isso. Entendo que seja bem palat√°vel pro ocidente e que em que pese ser um √≥timo filme, existam filmes muito melhores no pa√≠s de origem, mas continua excelente.

Parasite is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. The film, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun, follows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family and infiltrate their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
To begin with I want to give more of a heads up than anything else for my followers who can empathize when I say: foreign films can be conceptually intimidating.
I've never been very good at giving a movie in my full intention (This applies to even the ones that I like. I know. Shame on me.).
That said: Joon-ho‚Äôs Adoration for he Coen Brothers is in full effect here with ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô being filled with exceptionally heavy dialogue. What's important to note, however, is that this isn't to a detriment, and is instead ùíìùíÜùííùíñùíäùíìùíÜùíÖ to escort viewers through a maze of tonal shifts and significant points of Discord or chaos.
If I might indulge I would say that it is difficult to neglect commenting on the pacing and which ‚ÄòParasite‚Äôs exposition is developed. Conflicts and their subsequent solutions emerge inconsistently and at times makes the narration seem mildly distracted by the bigger purpose it obviously has in mind. A large amount of deception must be fulfilled in order to force ‚ÄòParasite‚Äôs hand, and as a consequence of this it becomes naturally filled with plot holes that are not easily filled or ignored outright. This is only excavated by the extent in which some overwhelming convenience and detached coincidences are used to carry much of ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô through its first half. Regardless, expertly crafted tension makes this one point that is easily forgiven and temporarily stifles this complaint.
What might come as a surprise to viewers is that Joon-ho originally conceptualized ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô as a play; with a clear understanding of the advantage specific vantage points can play in addition to the intricate set design the chance to make this a feature film is seamlessly unparalleled. Voyurist motifs are integrated as a way of instigating a ‚Äúpredator versus prey‚Äù dynamic between the Kim and park family with certain features (like stairs) literally elevating the sharp contrast between the complacently wealthy and the begrudgingly impoverished. Equal parts forthcoming and mysterious: Hong Kyung-pyo executes Joon-ho‚Äôs vision with the use of visual disparities that are endlessly stunning.
(Fun fact: The set design of the affluent Park family house was made completely from scratch in addition to the view of the environment just immediately outside of the Kim‚Äôs family home).
I have yet to know if any film has claimed an official monopoly on plot twists - but if so ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô is a more than worthy contender. From the first moment of climatic surprise Joon-ho and Jin-won put their foot on the accelerator with no intention of laying off of the metaphorical gas that keeps viewers guessing. This isn't just to say that some conclusions are completely unexpected - because in hindsight some seem unavoidable in the grander context - but the delivery throughout remains hauntingly engaging. Over time its viewers become a pi√±ata with ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô acting as a fustigating stick: with each of its devastating blows any sense of optimism (and quite literally some jaws) are forced into a state of submission that mimics the ground underneath them.
Ushered along by a class act of ‚ÄòChameleon-aires‚Äô: ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô transcends above what would otherwise be mundane and monotonous commentary as it relates to fiscal and social stratification. Taking away ( but not completely removing) avenues of sympathy while remaining ambiguously hopeful - the gaps between what someone is, what someone aspires to be, and what someone is capable of a coming are violently exploited, meticulously explored, and proficiently examined.
An archaic reminder transformed by an excess of cruel originality: ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô stresses the importance of being careful what you wish for... because in the end you just might get it (and more).
I would recommend.
Side note: In watching this my 'favorite first watch of 2021' has been officially dethroned."

Brilliant direction by Bong Joon-ho and exceptional performances by the cast elevate the storyline even further. The set designs are so well-thought-out that they perfectly capture the class divide. Clever exploration of societal inequality and human nature prompts this film as a must watch piece of art. Is it enthralling? Yes! Is it thought-provoking? Yes! Did the suspenseful plot twist made this film more prestigious? Yes!
My first ever Bong Joon-ho film and it didn't disappoint!

2020-01-30T02:03:03.296Z,2.5,"The most overrated movie I've seen in a long time. Had I run into it without its attendant hype, ""Parasite"" would've offered nice surprises. But it comes with the baggage of winning the Palm D'Or--I misspell it on purpose because I'm a poor hick, not a rich bastard like the people who attend that festival--and the Oscar nomination for Best Picture of 2020. The expectations are too high.
Best Picture?!? This is a plot that supplies itself with whatever it needs to. When hidden characters must reveal themselves, they make noise at the right moment. When characters need to come home unexpectedly in order to unknowingly surprise other characters who think they will be gone longer, they come home early.
When a character comments on an unpleasant stinkbug, he himself will become a metaphor for a stinkbug.
The rich in this movie occupy the upstairs. The poor occupy the downstairs. I believe I saw that a lot, in ""Downton Abbey,"" for example. And in just about every other piece of English film and literature for the last, I don't know, 500 years! Maybe this trope is new to Korea, and if so, I will excuse ""Parasite"" from using it.
It's also hard for me to get beyond the fact that this movie stereotypes everybody, and reductively. The poorer characters are clever schemers who use their brains only to commit crimes. The richer characters are oblivious idiots who say offensive things unwittingly, because they are oblivious.
Mix these two types of characters together, and you get a predictable plot, especially after the revelation in the middle of the movie about what secret lies within the house.
The movie says a lot about plans and not having plans. But it doesn't say anything about stealing the plans of other screenwriters, like this movie does. (If only Preston Sturges could rewrite and shoot this movie.)
This movie also contains the longest, and thus the most ridiculously impractical, Morse Code message ever sent in the history of movies.
I could keep going. On the positive end, the director's compositions are mostly a delight to see. The segment involving the maid and the peaches was remarkably well done. I might use that in film class as an example scene.
What's weird is that class-based critiques have gone the way of the dinosaurs, at least in the United States, with race and gender trumping it, as even poor people of the wrong race and gender are labelled ""privileged."" (I do not judge this phenomenon; I only observe.)
""Parasite"" enables Hollywood to recall its heritage as a mouthpiece for the working-class, while in reality the wealthy people in that ""industry"" continue to employ cheap labor for service jobs at low wages.
Palme D'Or voters had to think about whether their servants might one day attack them, or did they not reflect on the movie's obvious statements about the size of their bank accounts and its relationship to their ethical behaviors? Why would they vote for this movie? Self-loathing?
I won't mind-read those voters‚Äô motives, though. ""Parasite"" has some simplistic class messages that have some timely resonances, but which, because of their simpleness, also reduce the overall complexity of the work. The movie is less an artwork than it ought to be."

2022-03-21,5.0,"Ghastly contortions of morality bludgeon any manicured perceptions of action one may have leave the audience most certainly dumbfounded to the callous intelligence of the labyrinthine fracturing facades that Parasite unyieldingly suffocates one with in a macabre symphony of riveting accounts and proportions. Emphatically inconspicuous is it‚Äôs thesis on the inexorable triad of class, psyche and morality, one in its seethingly fierce discretion injects a near cerebral nature to Parasite‚Äôs already deafening opera of erratically swirling ethos. 
The aforementioned triad of complexities each inform the others perception, be it a society informing class or the latter moulding a psyche only to have one‚Äôs morality dismembered by the unfeeling weight of the other two. Parasite‚Äôs blemished tapestry entwines into itself a discordant avenue for every minutia of its setup that all crescendos in drama of the most supreme demeanour. 
Parasite paints on a canvas starkly vacant. It comes with no presumed perceptions, empty in its intent to have favour towards some, concocting the most deviously hostile of machinations to distort each convoluted virtue. It‚Äôs action is just that, a stained portrait for the observer to discern; devoid of external virtue as it own takes twisted form. Visceral virtue thrives within the the quietly unembellished confines of Parasite‚Äôs blurred nature of narrative control. 
‚ÄòWhere does this go from here?‚Äô - is the question I found myself continually pondering over just when another staggering deviation that thunderously jolts the narrative maintaining it‚Äôs ever suffocating chokehold on the audience‚Äôs mind. I was fortunate enough to go into this surprisingly unspoiled and with each moment of brilliance my eyes opened wider as I sat awestruck at the sight of Parasite‚Äôs hypnotically breathtaking montage - esque strings of bewildering progressions. 
I‚Äôm not one to often make it a point to remark on the specifications and intricacies of a film‚Äôs direction since, in all honesty I‚Äôm familiar with the technical works for filmmaking but a peculiarly particular fact of note was Parasite‚Äôs construction and dissection of the geography of a location and scene. Informing the audience‚Äôs thrill and framing a narrative around itself the geometry of the Park house is as much a contributor to the startling brutality of the narrative as the glacially spiralling psyche of our characters. 
Now granted I will admit I‚Äôm perhaps being quite overbearing with my appreciation for Parasite but (and I‚Äôm ludicrously late in saying this) but it indeed does feel like an achievement in the perception and reception of non-English cinema and staunchly earns it‚Äôs place as the most popular film on this app. 
I‚Äôll most definitely be more critical the second time ‚Äòround but this was STUNNING.

How and why it took me this long to watch this I have no clue and it‚Äôs the single film my extremely non-film-interested friends have recommended."
2021-07-18,4.5,Do it clockwise. ‚è∞
2021-06-23,5.0,"All you‚Äôll have to do is come up the stairs.
What is a metaphor? My personal definition is that a metaphor is something simple and concrete that conveys something much more complicated and abstract. In film, metaphors are particularly strong, because they can be visually dynamic as well as narratively. Bong Joon-Ho is perhaps the human being with the deepest understanding of a metaphor. He knows how to make one ebb and flow, how to make you comfortable with a metaphor without consciously knowing it is one, how to mix and match different metaphors to create distinct motifs to create brilliant themes, and most of all, how to imbue a film with so much metaphorical substance that it becomes a metaphor itself. The film I‚Äôm talking about is, of course, Parasite. And while the film is easily one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in a wide variety of ways, today I‚Äôd like to break down the first ten minutes of Parasite - with a specific focus on Bong Joon-Ho‚Äôs metaphorical prowess. Because indeed, nobody has ever mastered the art of cinematic metaphor quite like him.
The film opens with the title ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù superimposed upon the basement of the Kims‚Äô semi-basement window and the opening piece of score playing - the screenplay describes it as ‚Äúdark, but curiously upbeat.‚Äù This bit of score is perhaps the most interesting one in the film, as you can hear it going up and down - but not directly, more so in symphonic formation akin to climbing stairs. As we‚Äôll find out later, climbing up and down stairs is extremely important. The window in the semi-basement is grimey, and doesn‚Äôt let in very much light. Light, too, is very important to this film. The day outside is a bright summer day, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it because we only get a little bit filtered into Kims‚Äô home. Half of their home is aboveground, half underground. In less than 15 seconds, the two most important metaphors in the film have been established. The metaphor of stairs, which represent going up and down in social status; and the metaphor of light, which represents the amount of opportunity and affluence that lies ahead. So we can interpret that the Kims have some opportunity to gain wealth, but it is partially obscured by their place in society - both figuratively and literally, since they live half-underground.
The camera pans down to Ki-Woo, the Kims‚Äô son. Their neighbor‚Äôs WiFi has had a password put on it, so they no longer have any. Immediately, in the first line of dialogue, we are introduced to our first set of parasites: the Kims - at the moment, just for something as simple as WiFi. We also quickly learn what this could mean: the Kims could lose access to job opportunities. They will descend even further if they don‚Äôt get this WiFi. We are introduced to the rest of the family - Ki-Jung (the Kim‚Äôs daughter), Chung-Sook (the matriarch), and Ki-Tek (the patriarch). We also learn of a key aspect of Ki-Tek‚Äôs personality - he always has a plan. For the moment, it is to advise his son ‚Äúfor WiFi, hold it high.‚Äù He follows this advice, and eventually connects to a network in the highest part of the semi-basement: the Kims‚Äô toilet. More metaphors here, all having to do with the theme of ascension and stairs. He has to climb the stairs to get to his toilet, where he finds a signal. In other words, the Kims‚Äô are leeching off those higher than them - once again, both literally and figuratively. And of course, the fact that the highest part of the Kims‚Äô apartment is a toilet which you need stairs to get to is a metaphor, too. This is only confirmed when Ki-Jung can‚Äôt get a signal standing below the toilet, she has to climb up to get it.
The film then cuts to the family folding boxes for a pizza chain, working together to earn a meager wage by folding as many boxes as they can, as fast as possible. They watch from a video tutorial, given to them by Ki-Woo. Ki-Woo is consistently the person in the family who leads the rest to prosperity. This is the first sign of it: he is the one who provides the tutorial, allowing them to work faster. Meanwhile, Ki-Tek is the man with the plan. A fumigation truck passes by, and Ki-Jung suggests they close the window. But Ki-Tek says to leave it open, as it will kill all the insects that plague their home. It will kill all the parasites. As the fumes make the rest of the family cough and complain, Ki-Tek continues to fold boxes, looking at the video obscured by the fumes. While this tells us something about Ki-Tek‚Äôs character - he loves to plan and will work hard to achieve that plan - it is also a bit of foreshadowing. The fumigation, designed to kill the parasites, harms three of the Kims. The same three Kims that are no longer parasites by the end of the film, because they have either died or failed. But Ki-Tek, who remains a parasite in the Parks‚Äô home to the very end of the film, is not harmed by this fumigation. In the next scene, the pizza worker is scolding them because they haven‚Äôt folded the boxes correctly. More specifically, Ki-Tek didn‚Äôt, when he was doing it during the fumigation. She talks very disrespectfully to Chung-Sook, even though she‚Äôs much younger than her. We see more of Ki-Woo‚Äôs personality as he dismantles the situation, laughing it off and proposing that a Kim could take the job of an AWOL part-time worker. Another instance of them being parasites. But they aren‚Äôt the only ones - the pizza workers are obviously parasites, too.
The Kims sit down to dinner, Ki-Tek jokingly saying that they must celebrate the bounteous WiFi (which they parasitically got from a place ‚Äúhigher‚Äù than them). Ki-Woo‚Äôs wealthy friend Min rides down the street, yelling at a man peeing in the street, and walks down into the Kims‚Äô home. He arrives uninvited and walks in without knocking. Later in the film, the Kims will have to walk up a series of stairs and open a series of doors just to get into the Parks‚Äô home. Bong is showing us how rich people impose themselves upon poorer people, while poor people have to go through a series of steps just to meet them. Also, notice how Min‚Äôs journey to the Kims is entirely downward. He gifts them with the scholar‚Äôs rock, which is promised to bring material wealth to families. Ki-Woo notes that the rock is ‚Äúvery metaphorical.‚Äù Indeed, it is. He and Min go have a drink on the corner. Min‚Äôs scooter is again parked on a hill sloping up, as if it came from a place far ‚Äúhigher‚Äù than this. Min comments that the Kims look healthy, and Ki-Woo replies that they are healthy, but broke. It is then that Min pulls out his phone, and proposes that Ki-Woo tutor a rich college girl that he has been tutoring, and wants to date. He says he doesn‚Äôt want any of his college friends ‚Äúslobbering all over her.‚Äù This proposition taking place right after Ki-Woo states they are broke is not an accident. Min could have done so because he felt bad for Ki-Woo, but that‚Äôs only part of it. It is heavily implied that he looks down on his friend, and only trusts him with Min because he doesn‚Äôt think somebody so poor could be any competition. However, this trust is misguided, especially since it is Min‚Äôs idea for Ki-Woo to pose as a college student. At first, Ki-Woo is hesitant, but then a bus passes, and you can see the change in his face. This is when his character begins to have a clear goal: climb the social ladder and integrate himself into the Parks‚Äô home. The scholar‚Äôs rock is the embodiment of this desire. Throughout the film, Ki-Woo is trying to imitate Min. And while Min disappears after this scene, the rock is the remnant of his character. Just like Min, Ki-Woo is destined for something greater - or so he believes.
And with that, we are a mere ten minutes into the film. But in spite of this, we know everything there is to know, thanks to some of the most efficient exposition I‚Äôve ever seen in a film. Using metaphors, dialogue, and visual cues, Bong Joon-Ho has expertly shown us the Kim family. He has shown us their lack of wealth, how each of them have a key personality trait, how they reach upward and see light, but ultimately still live in a semi-basement and experience the sun through a dirty slit of a window. He has shown how they live parasitically, feeding off of people like the AWOL pizza worker and the coffee shop from whom they use WiFi. He has shown us Min, and how Ki-Woo strives to be like him, and how this desire is reflected via the scholar‚Äôs rock. Key metaphors have been introduced - besides the rock, we have the motif of light and the motif of stairs. The stinkbug that Ki-Tek flicks is even a bit of foreshadowing for the symbolic smell that will govern the climax. In ten minutes, we know exactly what film we are going to get - one with outstanding metaphors, complex characters, and fantastic direction and writing. And the rest of Parasite is all this and more. There‚Äôs some phenomenal montages, a groundbreaking twist in the vein of Psycho, and the cinematography and production design and editing consistently team up to make your jaw drop. Seriously, how many people actually noticed that the Kims and the Parks always have a line in the background to separate them, and they almost never cross it, a visual example of how the Park father even says that he loves how Ki-Tek never crosses the line? And when Ki-Woo is having a final moment of self-reflection, he looks out the window and there is a line between his reflection that is obscured by light (another motif) and his actual face. It‚Äôs because of moments like these that Parasite is probably the best film I‚Äôve ever seen - though 12 Angry Men remains my favorite. Well, not entirely because of this. What really wins me over is that Parasite has fundamentally changed how I think about class structure.
There is more than one parasite in Parasite. The Kims are parasites, obviously. The bugs they squash in their home are parasites. The pizza worker is a parasite, docking the pay they desperately need even though she also utilizes the work they‚Äôve done for her. The Parks are parasites. They utilize the labor that is provided to them, often without even recognizing that it is being provided. A clear example of this is Oh Geun-sae and how he turns on the lights for Mr. Park, but Mr. Park assumes they are automated. And they are incredibly ignorant, too. Mrs. Park tells her friend how the storm was a blessing, since it cleared out the sky for their son‚Äôs birthday party. The night before, tens of thousands of people lost their homes because of the very same storm. But they got to enjoy it on their lawn, protected from the elements by their twenty-million-dollar home. But really, none of these people are truly parasites. They are simply forced to be. The aforementioned storm is a great way to visualize what I mean. The Parks aren‚Äôt impacted by the rain because they exist at the top, and the water flows downward. We see the Kims running back to protect their home, and they run almost entirely downhill. The water gets deeper and deeper as they approach their home, and it is 100% flooded when they reach it. They escape with only a few of their belongings, while the Parks‚Äô son camps out on the lawn in his American-made tent, enjoying the rain. Everyone has to be a parasite, because that is how the city is built. At the end of the film, Ki-Woo tells his father, who is trapped in the Park‚Äôs basement, that he will earn enough money to buy the house. Then, he says, all he‚Äôll have to do is come up the stairs.
But as we cut back to Ki-Woo in his semi-basement home, we realize he‚Äôll never save enough money to buy the house. It is simply too far away. He has to ascend too far to reach this goal, it is impossible. It would take 564 years for him to do so, according to Bong Joon-Ho. Ki-Tek will never be able to climb up the stairs. He is trapped in the basement. He is trapped by the system. So he will live out the rest of his days as a parasite, in order to survive. And so will everyone else. If there‚Äôs one thing Parasite taught me, it‚Äôs this.
The system is the real parasite.

Parasite (2019) is a difficult film for me to review because I found myself emotionally agitated by the viewing, a feeling that returns any time I think back on its content. This seems to be, at least in part, due to a dark, playful voyeurism, very reminiscent of Hitchcock, used as a bridge from the realistic to the absurd. 
The story, design, cinematography, and sound of this film intertwine in a subtle harmony that is difficult to articulate, especially without spoilers. What you should take away from this review is that Bong Joon-ho pulls off something that most art films cannot, and that is exceptionally well-made and entertaining film that does not have hide its weaknesses behind gimmicks. 
There are lot of opinions out there about who got ‚Äúsnubbed‚Äù this award season so I know this isn‚Äôt a commonly held opinion, but I think the Academy‚Äôs greatest miss this year is a failure to recognize the absolutely phenomenal performances by the cast of Parasite. I understand that there are no clear standouts within the acting group of Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam or Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Jung Ji-so, and Jung Hyun-jun, but that isn‚Äôt an accident. It is the result of excellent characters, skillful acting, and onscreen chemistry. 
Born of cunning design and meticulous care, Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs final product, Parasite (2019), effortlessly passes between its sharply contrasting components in an almost indescribable manner that you need to see to believe."
2019-12-06,5.0,‚ÄúMoney is an iron.‚Äù
2019-11-08,4.0,"So.... any of you heard of Parasite? It's a pretty good movie. Wouldn't want it to get lost in all the new movie excitement and have no one notice.
Really though, Parasite is quite good. It's my first Bong Joon-ho film (I know, I know), so it's worth keeping in mind that I lack the context of his other works, should that make any difference. But writing about something that has now become the 2nd ranked film on this entire website is honestly kind of annoying -- let's just say that 4 stars is a quite good rating, and I have few complaints about the movie, it just didn't connect and grab me well enough to really get the highest ratings. Such is life, just if you're looking for me to ""justify"" rating this lower than 76% of this website has, you're going to be disappointed. I won't deny feeling a degree of ""Oh... that was it?"" when considering the ridiculous hype people have surrounded this film in, but that came from me feeling a constant ""Hey this is good"" but virtually never feeling ""Wow this is spectacular"" or however you want to phrase it.
In a technical sense, the hype is easy to understand. Joon-ho (along with cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo) is able to squeeze beauty out of every shot. Whether in the architectural wonder-house of the rich family or the dingy basement of the poor one, virtually every shot is interesting to look at. The actors are great as well across the board. Through writing and interactions the Kim (poor) family is endearing, feeling like a real family with bonds to each other. The Parks (rich) are just as good but in a slightly more cold, distant way -- there's the sense that they do care about each other, but their possessions, servants, and busy lives have almost served to detach them from each other. Money has made life far easier, but it has also eroded some human connections.
Though the rich are never quite attacked by the film as harshly as I expected. The wealth and luxuries that the Parks have shield them from ever thinking about those who are less fortunate. As presented here, they aren't callous or greedy; they are just entirely ignorant. For Parasite, the rich just were fortunate, probably from birth, to be shielded from the harsh reality that the poor live. They make games out of the events (for example, heavy rainfall) that might ruin other people's lives. They just don't know. There's no doubt a degree of truth to that, but I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it; I think I may have preferred if the film gave us the opportunity to see how they react when faced with people who have been screwed over by the system.
I do enjoy the way that throughout the film, the poor are shown to idolize the rich, though. The Kims think the Parks are nice because they have money. There are some spoiler-y parallels later in the film to people who are suffering and just barely able to get by in some capacity who want to thank the wealthy for indirectly allowing them to... not quite die. It's hopefully changing, but ""wealthy people are good"" is certainly a fallacy that exists. The infighting and scrambling for crumbs among the poor is an important theme to see displayed here, too.
If I really had to dig in for a complaint, I think I'm just not quite feeling the ending of this film. It might be better off without that epilogue at all. Either way, to some degree I did enjoy the amusing setup of the first half more than the tense payoff of the second. The later parts of the movie almost felt too much like what people expect from popular Korean films, if that makes sense. Not to say it's a good idea to paint a country's film output with such a wide brush, but I think there are certain storytelling trends that international audiences associate with the country and Parasite indulged in the way that those would lead me to expect.
Still, Parasite is a cool movie. Focus on those words and not the other ones. I hate feeling like a grumpy contrarian when giving something this high of a rating."

2019-10-25,5.0,what. am i not gonna give this shit five stars. come on.
2019-09-06,4.0,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a Discreet Charm of Bourgeoisie with a thriller spin. At its heart it's about how the poor cannibalize each other in hopes of living a lifestyle of the rich instead of demanding any change from the disparity between rich and poor. And though there are lots of twists, it's the buildup first-to-middle act, pre-twists, that is probably Bong's finest work as a filmmaker. It is precise, machine-like, and funny. And most biting in this satire is the respect that the rich receive simply for being rich, seemingly possessing no identifiable human qualities other than their impressive house by a famous architect.
For where the film ends up going, and I won't write that up here as it's best to go in extremely cold, I think Bong stays on the surface a little too much. It works best as a parable and shows a few blemishes in biting satire. Bong focuses on the separate society walls that make the rich so gullible to this family of grifters (employment recommendations are the highest currency because just getting to their doorstep is perceived as having walked a pre-vetted and merited path to get there) but also, Bong hinges most of the third act on a repeated comment of how the rich family views their staff as not fitting in: their smell. (""It's the smell of people who ride the subway."") And while this is an astute and stinging observation of class not just being money but a perceived elevation as more human, at first blush, it feels like Bong lets the rich family get away with too much. This works when they're presented to us through the parasitic poor family, because they're craftily taking advantage and also would like to live in such a house themselves, but when the closing carnage spins from this observation, it does feel like the most minor complaint of the rich when it comes to inequality. More telling is that prior to this spin, the rich patriarch of the family says ""consider this your job"" and reminds the double pay for a day, which was originally off, and how when someone rich pays for your presence they feel entitled to use it for whatever purpose imaginable that day."

2024-04-12,5.0,"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if you kill someone or betray your country, nobody cares. Got it?
Wow.
Going into to that, I thought it was going to be overrated. It was quite the opposite.
The whole movie was quite literally perfect, every seen masterfully planned out, down to every minute detail. All of the props and set design and script were excellent, especially all of the foreshadowing.
It was quite comedic, so I was surprised at the ending. Much more tragic, even if it did eventually turn out ok. It was almost as if the director wanted to blend a wholesome/tragic ending together. I thought that it was done very well.
The music score was excellent.
The cast were all new actors, and often this is actually a great idea, like in Breaking Bad or All Quiet on the Western Front. The acting was overall very professionally conveyed, which shows that all-star casts in movies are not always a good thing.
For some reason, while the whole thing was in Korean, I think that made it better. Obviously I had subtitles on, but it lets you hear how the language can convey different emotions compared to English.
The only problem I have is the rock. The rock was a cool concept, even if it ended up in the wrong hands, but I think it should have had more backstory/screen time. It's literally on the poster for the movie (on netflix, not here), and it didn't play a very big part overall, which I think it could have done."

Illusions that give power 
Unequal treatment 
The way the shot compositions frame and position the characters throughout the movie is a harsh reminder that the status quo will eventually reset. The way character find humanity through struggle when dealing with manifestations of the barriers within classism is heartbreaking to see. Especially when those who are safe and secure lack humanity or have to put on a face to display humanity to others. A distinct contrast to those who have to pretend to lack humanity just to blend in and attempt to succeed. Self deception projected as a false means to achieve success. A myth so ingrained that it functions to eventually reveal the flaws of those who try to play the system to their advantage. In turn, ascribing more power to the top.

2021-11-22,5.0,"Do I even need to get into a preamble about the value and impact of Parasite? Is there truly anything that hasn't already been said about Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus? Could I have picked a better film to reel in my 23rd birthday? The answer to all of these questions is probably no, but after two meme reviews and a third separate watch, it feels like the fourth viewing of this masterpiece is due for a proper evaluation on my part.
With each rewatch, I find myself noticing new details in Parasite that make it that much more rewarding. Last time, I got a particular kick out of Mr. Park commending Ki-taek for being consistent in his profession only a scene or two after he just finished relaying to his family a series of failed career prospects. This time, I finally picked up on an early line that supports a clever double-meaning: when Ki-woo grabs Da-hye's wrist to check her pulse and says, ""The heart doesn't lie."" It's moments like these that make Parasite such a joyous experience to undertake over and over again. (After 4 viewings, the only thing that still confounds me is a line in which Chung-sook, after discovering the hidden bunker and its inhabitant, states ""So that's how it happened."" What ""it"" is she referring to exactly? Someone let me know!)
Very few films find their directors applying such unbroken focus in which every single decision made, both on the page and behind the camera, feels absolutely motivated and essential. Even bits that go unexplained like Moon-gwang's bruises and whether or not Da-song ends up living through his seizure in the end just add to the flavourful presentation. Bong sets up every important piece of information with pitch-perfect foresight, allowing for crucial occurrences to take place without ever feeling contrived (like the CCTV cameras being cut off, for instance).
A perfect example is the first scene in which we see the basement, when Moon-gwang retrieves the plum extract. Had the scene just consisted of her retrieving the juice, astute audience members would have put two and two together and immediately realized that this setting, which has never appeared before, would probably come into play more significantly down the road. But by having Yeon-gyo follow her and ask her there to spy on her daughter's English lesson, rather than waiting for the housekeeper to return upstairs, the first-time viewer is placed off-guard from the significance of that meeting's setting. Absolutely brilliant!
We may not live to see another moment that shook the filmgoing world like the Parasite shockwave that began with its unanimous rave reviews out of Cannes and culminated in a groundbreaking triumph at the Oscars. With South Korea's growing prominence in North American pop culture (mostly in the form of KPOP), it only seemed right that their movies would, at some point, reach such levels of widespread exposure. The fact that the movie in question would not only be widely accessible to a general audience, but would also happen to be an undisputed masterpiece, is just too good to be true. But man, did Bong earn every scrap of that praise!
That not a single person I've met who's seen Parasite has had anything but awe and admiration to heap upon its weary shoulders is a testament to ""the little movie that could"" taking the full David-and-Goliath route towards victory and emphasizing the true power of cinema. Such a powerhouse this is, in fact, that after so much justified ambiguity surrounding the film leading up to its release, I feel fully confident in writing this massively spoilerific review without any qualms, because you've all seen it, and I know you've all seen it! Well, see it again, because I've perused a few concerning 4-star ratings here and there, and if we're being perfectly honest, anything less than a 4-and-a-half (and even that's low-balling it) for Parasite is highly suspect..."

""It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.""
One Palme d'Or, four Oscars, the #1 spot in Letterboxd's Top 250... Parasite has surfed a wave of unimaginable hype over the last year. So naturally my interest was peaked. I prepared by watching Memories of Murder, The Host, and Mother, and loved them all. I went to the theatre, bought a ticket, and took my seat in a packed screening.
So is it better than The Godfather, as LB would have you believe? I don't know about that, but this film is absolutely spectacular in every single way.
I'd argue that Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's best movie to date. His most meticulously crafted, most intellectually stimulating, most emotionally compelling. The culmination of a career. Yet when judged as a standalone effort, it's still a profoundly exhilarating cinematic experience. Bong's directorial technique is impeccable, his writing incredibly perceptive. As if that's not enough, you also get glossy production design, a memorable musical score, super slick editing, and an ensemble of perfect performances. I have no criticisms whatsoever, even upon a first viewing.
Ultimately, what we have here is a crucial reminder of the power movies can hold over us. Most awards contenders are forgotten in a year, consigned to the footnotes of history. Not Parasite. I predict cinephiles are gonna be talking about this one for decades to come. As well they should."
2020-02-10,5.0,Where were you when Parasite swept?
2019-08-06,5.0,"As a fan of Bong Joon-ho I was very excited to see this film and I'm very glad I was able to as soon as I could, especially considering I was particularly excited to see him making another Korean language film. This film somehow lived up to the already immense hype surrounding it from Cannes and elsewhere, blowing me away and being probably his best film and possibly the best film of the year.
This film overall was an absolute blast to watch. Anyone who's familiar with this director will definitely expect certain aspects of filmmaking quality that are basically a trademark in all of his films, like the impressive direction and pitch-perfect staging of the actors as well as the perfectly balanced blend of different tones. This rings very true with this film as well, with this last aspect being especially well-handled: it is pretty astonishing to see a film that is both funny, intense and scary each in really effective ways, sometimes all within the same scene, and just shows how much this director is in control of his craft, creating an experience that‚Äôs a true rollercoaster of emotions.
Almost every individual aspect of this film is top-notch. The acting is absolutely fantastic: all the actors do an excellent job performing and portraying their characters, with the characters themselves each having a lot of depth to them and being very well-defined, memorable and unique and entertaining in their own ways; each one has their purpose in the film and adds to the overall experience, and by the end of the film you feel like you know them like the palm of your hands, caring for them in everything they go through. The writing in general is just fantastic and pretty brilliant: if the superb handling of different tones and the careful detail in the characters weren't already enough, it also has a very engaging and entertaining plot and sequence of events that manages to be unpredictable with twists and turns while at the same time making subtle statements and having a lot of subtext to interpret and think about after the film ends, with plenty of clever and purposeful reincorporation as well.
The pacing is absolutely phenomenal and pretty much perfect: the film grabs you from the very beginning and constantly moves along, never feeling boring in the slightest and making the 2h12min runtime just fly by, with every scene developing the story and/or characters accordingly.
The music was also absolutely fantastic, accentuating different tones very well, and very appropriately used, making certain scenes exhilarating and an absolute blast to watch; it's very well shot with great shot composition and lighting, making certain shots look absolutely beautiful, and it has consistently great camerawork that always complements the scene. The set design is fantastic as well and, last but not least, this film has one of the best and most powerful resolutions and ending scenes to a film I've seen in a while.
This film blew me away and had me enthralled and in awe as I was watching it, being one of the most engaging experiences I've had with a film in a very long time, and after letting it sit for a couple of days it's constantly growing on me the more I think about it and I'm becoming more and more certain that it's a masterpiece, and I really don't have any issues with it other than very small nitpicks that are honestly fading away the more time passes and hold less value the more I think about them. I think that a film that I enjoyed immensely and thoroughly and also left me with plenty to think about for days after watching it is pretty exceptional, and the more I think about it the better it gets and I can see myself rewatching it a million times in the future, since it has everything I would want out of a film.
Sooooo yeah, Bong Joon-ho knocked it out of the park with this. This is a film that's not even been released in most of the world as of now and yet I think it might already be a classic (and I can see it appearing on the IMDb Top 250 someday as well): it is a crazy experience that is incredibly effective in multiple ways, being really accessible and entertaining while at the same time pretty challenging in its own ways, and I seriously cannot wait to see it again. I will definitely need to revisit this and ""Memories of Murder"" to determine which one is my favorite but regardless you should probably check out every film in Bong Joon-ho's filmography. If you want to see a master of his craft at work then I'd definitely recommend checking this one out as soon as you can. Don't look up anything and just GO SEE IT, you definitely won't regret it."
2019-07-02,3.5,"""[...] Bong‚Äôs socioeconomic themes‚Äîalso present in Lee‚Äôs Burning, another tale of class warfare, as well as the countless Korean shows and films pitting the haves against the have-nots‚Äîcan feel like a specifically Korean cinematic interest. That can be credited to South Korea‚Äôs uniquely rapid economic boom, which largely happened under the military dictatorship of President Park Chung-hee, who aggressively prioritized economic growth over civil liberties. ‚ÄúI turned 50 this year and during the past half-century, I watched Korea develop into a pretty rich nation,‚Äù Bong said. ‚ÄúBut, like Germany and first-world nations of Europe, the richer the country gets, the more the relative gap between the rich and the poor becomes wider. And so you get this polarization. And I think Korea is the same.‚Äù
In Parasite, that gap pervades every aspect of the two families‚Äô lives‚Äîin smell (an important part of the film) and in the literal climate. When a torrential storm hits, the Kims‚Äô abode is almost devastated, while the heavy downpour becomes a fun excuse for the Parks‚Äô young son to camp out in a tent in the front yard.

2020-08-19,5.0,"I missed this back in February when it was released in cinemas (remember those things?) and I guess I'm pretty late to the party now but, I held out and went in knowing as little as possible and now, well this is likely to be my favourite film of 2020.
I like how political cinema is getting right now, it's truly reflecting the deep inequalities of our time. I mentioned in my Joker review last year that political filmmaking cannot and indeed should not be the sole domain of my favourite filmmakers, Ken Loach or Mike Leigh, because their reach in terms of audience is much smaller than your average blockbuster. In my view genre cinema needs to be subverted to say something about the world we live in, challenge convention and call for change.
Parasite is genre cinema, it's just that the genre turns on a sixpence at any given moment. The first half is a glorious, playful long con; an entertaining hustle movie that is impossible to watch without a big smile on your face. Somewhere around the halfway mark however, the tone shifts. Drama dictates that a threat must arise and things suddenly get a lot more unpredictable and much darker. The genius of Bong Joon-Ho - and he is a genius, having watched just two of his films I feel wholly comfortable in saying that - is that these gear changes are as smooth as the driving of one of his central protagonists. Bong has an innate ability to prepare his audience by richly texturising every moment of his film so that we are aware of the social commentary that drives the narrative. It's impossible to ignore the depravation of the Kim family, just as it is equally impossible not to sympathise with their desire to seize upon the chance to better themselves, no matter how wicked, morally dubious or illegal their methodology in capitalising upon that chance may actually be. Indeed it is arguably here where Bong's social commentary reaches peak clarity; this is a film about the working classes set against one another for the scraps left behind by a sheltered, wealthy class who oftentimes scarcely even notice them... at least when they're downwind.
Parasite is an almighty success, defying the odds by being a rare Korean hit with Western audiences (to the chagrin of Donald Trump who obviously was hardly going to be a fan of anything that is at once both foreign and points out socio-economic inequality) simply because what it has to say transcends the language barrier. The notion of class inequality is universal, and Bong records it not just in a manner that is thought provoking, but in one that is both deeply thrilling, wickedly comic, wholly entertaining and beautifully played by his incredible ensemble cast."

Parasite is a complete masterpiece of filmmaking and theme through longing, meaningful cinematography, fantastic foreshadowing (the art teachers never last for long), and chilling visuals, especially the moment where the little boy encounters the ""ghost"". Through this, Parasite is able to create a realistic and terrifying depiction of wealth, resulting in a game of chance that the poverty cycle washes people through, leaving them worse off than when they started and right where they began."

Bong Joon-ho really played us. just when you're laughing, it turns into a thriller. just when you're invested in the drama, it hits you with horror. and the ending? brutal. because for people like the Kims, the dream of climbing the social ladder is just that a dream.

2019 Ranked
Foreign Film Quest
This film was yet another enjoyable experience from Bong Joon Ho. My favorite part of his directing style is how he brilliantly is able to incorporate such fun comedy elements in his very intense, dark and twisted themed stories.
This story takes you on such a wild ride of emotions as we witness this low class family slowly manipulate their way into the lives of an elite family as there mentors and employers and become seduced by their wealth. But around every corner we get thrown into more and more bizarre situations that are both quirky and thrilling and it makes for such an emotional and fun experience.
This bizarre black comedy is pulled off so well because of the phenomenal acting accompanied by beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack. And the characters are written with such depth that it gets you so invested in this story and plays with your fears and emotions this film was a wild ride and my favorite of Bong so far."

2024-08-14,5.0,"‚Äúit‚Äôs quite cruel and sad, but I thought it was being real and honest with the audience. you know and i know ‚Äî we all know that this kid isn‚Äôt going to be able to buy that house. i just felt that frankness was right for the film, even though it‚Äôs sad.‚Äù - bong joon-ho
: the director of this movie making it clear that in the end the son would not be able to buy a house like that, and would spend years knowing that his father would suffer and rot in that dark underground with almost no water and food, while a rich family lived happily above his head."
2021-12-01,0.5,"letterboxd is a massively-multiplayer online strategy game where you, your friends, and a bunch of really annoying people seek to apply labels (one, from a selection of ten) to rows in a database. each row is associated with an object from the set that roughly corresponds to ""movies"" (already a kind of hazy term, further confused on letterboxd by having some miniseries, web animations, promotional videos, but not really individual commercials most of the time, or tv shows)
now the catch is that these labels represent discrete numerical values along a 1-dimensional continuum. unlike some of my friends, i do think you could theoretically create quantitative representations of films such that some bureaucratic egregore could then categorize them in a generally non-odious way, but that would require some sort of vector value, aggregating assessments along an arbitrary number of axes. so the game is, knowing the great loss of information that comes with projecting these hypothetical n-dimensional quantitative assessments into 1-dimensional point values, how do you do it?
part of the fun of the game is that when you do this you get to write little messages either justifying your actions or just writing something stupid, or something insanely obnoxious like this
parasite (2019) is a movie that kinda disgusts me. it's admittedly entertaining, but in the same way that bo burnham specials feel like a liberal capitalist evaluation of ""does watching a cute 'woke' (derogatory) guy having a mental breakdown generate views"", this is ""does emptying a big bucket with POLITICS written on the side onto your thriller movie get views?"". the real horror is that it's basically impossible to evaluate whether or not bo burnham or bong joon ho is trying to do a ""genuine"" conveyance. hell, maybe ""genuine"" means something different when you're a real hot shot like those two! but it seems dull even to me to try to play armchair psychologist on these guys
the fact that letterboxd has a ""top 250 movies"" list generated from aggregated ratings situates the 5.0 as ""most valuable"" and 0.5 as ""least valuable"", in some sense, so there /are/ stakes involved. you select some guys and root for them to win the race. we can deduce people that letterboxd seems to attract can be assumed to be, generally, people that want parasite (2019) to win this race
in doing the sort of vector -> scalar projection we're talking about, people seem to kinda fall into two camps, the ""Lil' Structuralist"" who is assessing formal properties (and sometimes cultural context/importance) against some secret mercurial rubric that converts this analysis into Value, and the ""Fun Haver"" who claims to be able to reduce their emotional response (itself a very complicated value) into that scalar value. you know how it's kind of funny to see a review that is a series of more-or-less objective statements about some film in question, but then decides that that means the movie is bad when those are the reasons you like the movie? you can see how it breaks down
parasite (2019) presents some bits of information that a viewer could link to why the family is poor, but because they are repeatedly contradicted in the movie, it doesn't feel quite right. the son can't get into school, but even if he did, college graduates can't find jobs. except his college graduate friend who has a job, etc etc. since the family is repeatedly shown to be smart / charismatic / competent / ambitious, the conclusion is that they are Just Randomly Poor, though i think it would be not-invalid to read into it that poorness is somehow bioessential, with the connection to eg odor and the nature of rich people. by the end of the movie, everyone wronged by the entire ideal sort of shrugs and accepts this all as Just The Way It Is, I Guess, hoping that one day they themselves will get to be the rich players at the game.
which is to say, this isn't really a critique of anything, or even an analysis of anything, so much as it is a naked assertion of a liberal status quo that is then used to construct a thriller movie. this is what i meant when i called it ""class warfare as spectacle"" in my previous review.
it's pretty, it has clearly talented actors, it's paced well enough to be thrilling, but do you, like, care? martyrs also had that but i liked it more, ""dangerous encounters of the first kind"" was also thrilling and much more willing to actually take something resembling a stance. look! there's like 2 million good movies out there, do you /need/ parasite (2019)?? i understand how watching this is fun and an entertaining way to send 2 hours but like, the best movie of all time?? are you sure?? if the idea is that this represents a specifically korean form of filmmaking or cultural analysis, i would concede that but that's out of my league and dude /surely/ there are korean people saying shit far more interesting than this...
if letterboxd offers you anything above just watching movies and contemplating them alone, it certainly isn't tailored recommendations or new friendships, but it is getting this crude look at What The Sort Of People Who Use Letterboxd Think About Something, Generally. might as well use it! why not? it feels safe to deduce from the fact that it's the #1 movie on the site that whatever is happening here /works/ for people. like, super well. it feels like parasite (2019) correctly identified this major sales opportunity that eg squid game was able to use to catapult itself to being the #1 Most Worshipped Thing, except that squid game offered a lot more actual critique. in hindsight, it was safe to be a little more aggressive with the politics. ah well.
anyway, i bumped my rating down to 0.5 because ratings are stupid and i wanted to take this opportunity to help shove parasite (2019) off of being the #1 movie of all time. like, at least if it was Joker that'd be kinda funny. as it stands it just feels like this embarrassing, extremely 2021 way of signalling Yes, I Care About Politics! Parasite (2019) Is 10/10! without having to actually engage in things like analysis or self-reflection. plus it's cool!! a moment of catharsis! a+
edit: i was getting 'top movies' and 'most popular movies' confused, which means that parasite (2019) at #1 isn't fighting against Joker, it's fighting against fucking Come and See. technically, this /does/ make the fact that parasite (2019) is the top movie hilarious, but in a way where you can see a tic in my eye and beads of sweat on my forehead"
2019-11-21,5.0,"An incredible piece of stand-out foreign cinema. Utterly compelling, and packed with brilliant artistic choices and symbolism. This is a masterpiece."
2023-10-03,5.0,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: it's fucking Parasite, what can I say that hasn't been said a thousand times before?

Einfach √ºber nichts informieren und dieses Kunstwerk auf sich wirken lassen! Wirklich meisterhaft, wie Parasite jede m√∂gliche Erwartungshaltung wiederlegt und vollkommen zwanglos zwischen starken Ton√§nderungen variiert, ohne den erzielten Effekt zu verfehlen und erneut beweist, dass das koreanische Kino das faszinierendste der Filmindustrie bleibt. Vom gro√üartigen Schauspiel, der eindringlichen Tonarbeit und gl√§nzenden Kameraf√ºhrung mal ganz abgesehen bietet Parasite eine Vielschichtigkeit voll von Symbolik und frei von Konventionen, wie ich es selten gesehen habe."

Parasite is not just a great movie, it‚Äôs a statement. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Dear Bong Joon-ho, you are a certified cinematic genius. ‚ú®Ô∏è
This was my first time watching Parasite and honestly, It lands even harder in our current times. Maybe it‚Äôs me getting older and grumpier at capitalism, or maybe it's just that this film slices deep as a piece of social commentary, now more than ever.
At it's core, it's not just about the obvious rich vs. poor class dynamic, but the subtleties within it. The Kims live in a half-basement, half underground habitation. The Parks live high above in their perfect, minimalist home. You literally climb to get there. And the scariest part is that the Parks don‚Äôt even realize the Kims exist. Not until it crashes through the illusion and ruins their pretty little garden party.
That‚Äôs one of the most brutal things about the film, they don‚Äôt realize the Kim family is slowly taking over their lives, their house, their comfort, and even when they do sense something‚Äôs off, they frame it as a ""smell"", not a person, nor a circumstance, just an odor that doesn‚Äôt belong in their world. It‚Äôs so dehumanizing and it tells you everything.
The whole cast is phenomenal, but Song Kang-ho as the father is something else. There‚Äôs this quiet sadness in his eyes, like he's constantly swallowing pride, disappointment, and helplessness and it‚Äôs so devastating to see. Then there's Cho Yeo-jeong as Mrs. Park, who plays rich and oblivious so perfectly it hurts. Honestly every actor here came in with 200% commitment. ‚ú®Ô∏è
Don‚Äôt get me started on that ending. That hopeful, delusional, fantasy of making it out, of rising above your place in the world, and then the harsh cut back to reality. It‚Äôs one of the most haunting final shots I‚Äôve ever seen. üíØüí∏"

S√≥ que, apesar do plot e da reviravolta, ainda achei desnecess√°ria a morte da personagem mais querida pelo p√∫blico. Mas tamb√©m pude entender a ideia que eles queriam retratar, pois a realidade √© realmente imprevis√≠vel. Em geral, podemos ver que a felicidade de pobre dura pouco; tudo gira em torno da diferen√ßa de classes e mostrando tamb√©m como elas interferem na vida de cada um dos personagens. De in√≠cio, pensamos que o suspense est√° na fam√≠lia Parks, mas √© f√°cil entender que, mesmo com uma governanta maluca, um parasita no por√£o e uma fam√≠lia trambiqueira, as passagens provocativas e sutis dos Parks falam bastante por si s√≥s, usando a met√°fora do cheiro e a analogia da chuva. Algo que sempre podemos acompanhar pelos notici√°rios: √© dif√≠cil encontrar algu√©m que, em chuva forte e com uma casa com boa estrutura para prote√ß√£o, esteja pensando nos menos favorecidos que sofrem com a perda de bens e pessoas. √â um bom filme, e n√£o me arrependo de ter demorado tanto tempo para assistir. 1) Vi dublado, e eu n√£o teria paci√™ncia de assistir legendado; tamb√©m n√£o estaria fazendo essa review, pois n√£o conseguiria assistir e ler ao mesmo tempo. 2) N√£o √© a oitava maravilha do mundo. Eu gostei da hist√≥ria; o filme √© realmente muito bom, mas pensar na morte da melhor personagem, ver a forma rasa em que assuntos importantes foram abordados, a hist√≥ria mal contada do carinha que ofereceu o emprego pro garoto e da m√£e rica, a filha rica carente e mongol√≥ide, imaginar que o pai morrer√° no por√£o, pois o filho levar√° quinhentos anos para conseguir dinheiro para comprar aquela casa... Esses pontos n√£o me permitem dar 5 estrelas. Particularmente, eu adorei os saltos nos g√™neros: hora com√©dia, hora sitcom, hora suspense, hora terror, hora drama.

2024-07-04,5.0,"‚Äî Pai, hoje fiz um plano.
As classes desde que o capitalismo foi instaurado foram divididas. Para Karl Marx, √© determinado essa dividis√£o sendo: a classe prolet√°ria (qualquer um que recebe sal√°rio por um trabalho) e a classe burguesa (qualquer um que apenas usufrui do dinheiro sem trabalhar). Aqui, a divis√£o √© n√≠tida e as vidas das fam√≠lias Kim e Park s√£o quase que mundos paralelos, s√£o de realidades extremamente diferentes e a todo instante Bong faz quest√£o de nos lembrar disso.
Seja a composi√ß√£o visual da linha que divide os personagens pobres dos ricos, ou seja a alus√£o da escada e do cheiro, n√≥s somos obrigados a lembrar dos dois mundos: um vive no conforto, quase (ou praticamente) vivem na cegueira da realidade do mundo a fora e para solucionar a falta de comida na casa basta colocar o empregado para colocar a comida no carrinho enquanto voc√™ fala no telefone despretensiosamente; o outro vive numa luta di√°ria, todo dia √© uma preocupa√ß√£o, todo dia questionam se haver√° comida nos arm√°rios e na mesa, se haver√° dinheiro na conta e vivendo num lar um tanto desconfort√°vel. Este √© o mundo de Seul, mas tamb√©m √© o resto do mundo.
A fam√≠lia Kim vive encarando as dificuldades sociais todos os dias, est√£o ligados na realidade e por isso se sobressaem em rela√ß√£o aos Park, logo, engan√°-los e empregar toda a fam√≠lia para que uma alta quantidade de dinheiro fosse pra conta da casa se torna uma miss√£o relativamente f√°cil, relativamente, mas f√°cil. Por√©m √© nessa ideia que eles se deparam com Moon-gwang e seu marido: na mis√©ria, perseguidos, sem moradia fixa e sugando recursos do lar dos Parks, afinal, √© f√°cil enganar rico. A luta de classes ent√£o n√£o ocorre exatamente com ricos e pobres, e sim pobres e pobres. Por um instante at√© houve uma empatia de Chung-sook em dar comida para o casal, mas a necessidade de manter a mentira foi maior.
S√£o v√°rias necessidades e interesses postos e repostos um sobre outro gerando uma lamban√ßa e culminando na cena do massacre no anivers√°rio. A raiva e o cansa√ßo de ver essa segrega√ß√£o enrustida de ""bom tratamento com os empregados"" leva Ki-taek a matar Dong-ik, ao ver que ele sequer ligou para Geun-se o endeusando e agradecendo. N√£o importa pra eles se um da estat√≠stica os ama, no fim do dia permanacem sendo estat√≠stica de censo sobre a pobreza e mis√©ria. O pai at√© tentou armar o mais perfeito dos planos, mas a imprevisibilidade das mentiras, o segredo rec√©m-descoberto da casa, nada disso estava nos planos, matar Dong-ik e perder Ki-Jung n√£o estava nem de longe nos planos: uma necessidade, interesse e tentativa da fam√≠lia de sair da mis√©ria e das estat√≠sticas do censo.
Ki-woo, um mentiroso nato da fam√≠lia Kim, √© o cabe√ßa do plano e o g√™nio que pensou em empregar toda a fam√≠lia. Sua obsess√£o e fasc√≠nio pela pedra √© a cren√ßa fiel de que a lenda da pedra (o objeto significaria a sa√≠da da fam√≠lia da pobreza) se tornaria realidade, de que a pedra √© a ilumina√ß√£o que os Kim precisavam, e que por isso ela o perseguia. Ele a levou de casa ap√≥s a inunda√ß√£o e tentou confrontar Geun-se e Moon-gwang com ela, no final tudo foi por √°gua abaixo. E no desfecho da obra, acredita em outra lenda: a que ir√° comprar a mans√£o e resgatar seu pai. Infelizmente a morte est√° mais pr√≥xima do que a ascens√£o social para ele.
Juntamente com seu irm√£o, Ki-Jung √© a principal trapaceadora da casa, respons√°vel por convencer os Park com o diploma falso e at√© mesmo chocar Yeon-kyo sobre a ""terapia da arte"". Extremamente ativa no plano e continuou o ciclo de recomenda√ß√µes, ela possu√≠a interesses ego√≠stas e dizia querer priorizar o crescimento econ√¥mico da fam√≠lia. Usufruiu do prazer que √© ser rica e morar naquela mans√£o extraordin√°ria e ent√£o seu fim chegou. A mais esperta por√©m a primeira a morrer mas jamais esquecida.
Parasita √© sobre isso, √© sobre como todo mundo t√° se parasitando e um precisa do outro, pra sobreviver, pra se entreter, para ter renda ou prazer. √â sobre como a vida n√£o permite planos, pois sem planos nada pode dar errado, seria tantas as possibilidades do que pode acontecer se nada for planejado. √â sobre como a sociedade t√° num ciclo vicioso: o pai √© pobre e o filho tamb√©m, o vizinho t√° na mis√©ria ent√£o o pai eventualmente fica na mis√©ria tamb√©m, ou, o Ki-taek foge do caos que se tornou todo aquele plano para o bunker e l√° permanece, ocupando o lugar de foragido no subterr√¢neo de Geun-se j√° morto; o pai ent√£o vive l√° pelo resto dos dias, sem uma Moon-gwang para lhe dar comida toda semana, provavelmente at√© morrendo l√°, enquanto definitivamente sabe que n√£o deve esperar por ningu√©m, apesar do filho estar vivo e l√°, planejando mais uma vez o que ele foi aconselhado pelo pr√≥prio pai a n√£o fazer: planos.
Obs.: arrastei minha irm√£ pra ver comigo depois de anos implorando e ela gostou üôè"

Mr Bong Joon Ho‚Ä¶.. RESPECT!!"
2025-04-02,5.0,"Fuck capitalism
That ""smell crosses the line"" dialogue defines the invisible social divide deeply embedded in their minds eventho the Parks appear polite and pleasant on the surface. Mrs. Kim's reminds Me Kim that ""They're nice because they're rich, not because they're nice people"" strips away that illusion, revealing that their kindness is conditional, stemming from privilege rather than genuine goodwill. Their kindness towards the Kim's were nothing more than transactional which was a late understanding for me kim who always thought they were naive. The constitutional oppression and humiliation just goes beserk in the final 30 mins of the movie representing a long awaited retaliation against the system.
There are several instances throughout the movie that lays out the social and economic disparity with great depth and understanding. Bong even shows how the next morning after a flood is different for the rich and the poor as one is happy as the sun came out while the others are suffering as their life savings was washed away in that rain . The guy in the basement represents the social strata that are completely ignored and are even invisible to the Kims, the ultimate victims of capitalism where they don't even have an oppertunity to climb up and are constantly oppressed by everyone even slightly above them in social and economic status.
The trajectory of this movie is just so fucking amazing looking back how it starts and how it ends . The writing is layered, the comedy is dark and the performances are restrained and internal which makes us read what the charecters are thinking eventho there are visual queues throughout the movie ."
2021-06-22,5.0,"Without a doubt, the easiest 5 star rating I‚Äôve ever given. This film exceeds expectations on every possible level, even on a second watch. It is the most popular, and the highest rated film on Letterboxd for good reason. It appeals to the cinephile crowd by being filled with allegory and metaphor while exploring and questioning the underlining fundamentals of the systems that have always been in place, and it also appeals to general audiences by being one of the most wildly entertaining movies ever, excellent usage of editing, and an original premise which is fascinating enough to keep your interest for the entire film. I find the juxtaposition of the opposite social classes to be pretty spot on at times, but it‚Äôs effective nonetheless. If I had to say one negative thing about this film, it would be about how Bong portrays the lower class Kim family as people who are only capable of getting by through living a con life. But I also don‚Äôt fully disagree with this portrayal because in a way, the lower class is powerless to the hierarchies of a capitalist society. But really, Bong portrays this family as lazy over anything, unmotivated to even complete the simple task of folding pizza boxes. But this misportrayal of an entire social class is quickly lost in the insanity of the turn that the film takes in the second half. 
And what a turn this second half takes. A flawlessly executed change in tone if you ask me. It was at this point that Parasite flipped the switch, turning into a horrifying, subversive nightmare. The crazy thing about this tone shift is that it can‚Äôt even be called a plot twist. Every second after that doorbell rings is a different movie from the first half. Darker, more challenging, and as haunting as anything you have ever seen. I think I enjoy the first half of Parasite more than the second, but the second half of this film is indescribably amazing. It is for this second half that Parasite gets the reputation as the dark thriller that is possibly the finest film of this past decade. One of the aspects of this film I find most fascinating is the Park‚Äôs camping trip. The fact that rich people purposely worsen their living conditions for a short period of time, for leisure, is mind blowing to me when there are many lower class people who are living in tents every day barely getting by. This is an excellent example of the ignorance of rich people to those who live at a lower standard to them. The montages in Parasite are some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in cinema, with the peaches montage standing out among them all as the most well done. Parasite is one of the most greatest, most accessible  films that has come out in a while, their is no other way to put it. It is a masterpiece in all facets, and I find no major flaws in the film. 
Number 7 on my Top 50 favorites of all time"

'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.
I admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.
The movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.
The performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.
I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.
Overall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year."
2019-08-11,5.0,"- You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.
I was really scared the praise for this would lowkey ruin it for me because of expectations. Sometimes that happens when you watch a movie with excellent reviews. I am happy to confirm that was not the case here. This movie is PERFECT. The direction, the cinematography, the script, the performances. WOW.
Parasite is a movie directed by Joon-ho Bong and it won the Palm D' Or @ Cannes earlier this year and once you watch it, you understand why this has been praised by everyone. Its a movie hard to describe or box into any genre. Its funny, thrilling, suspenseful, exciting, and sad. Its a movie that you might think where its going, but oh boy! you have no idea. Its hard to guess and very unexpected. Joon-ho Bong really created a modern masterpiece of cinema. I really feel sorry for the people who avoid foreign language movies because they're too lazy to read subtitles. This movie cannot be missed. I cant wait to watch it again. Asian cinema has been on a roll these past years with Burning, shoplifters and this. Oh before I forget this is like shoplifters on steroids. That's how good it is.
MVPs: the 4 members of the family but the lady who played the previous made was a scene stealer.
PS: I know there's a few buzzy titles but I'm rooting so hard for this to win the foreign language movie @ the Oscars. It will be hard to top this one.
Thanks for reading. Have a good week yall!"

The movie starts off as a light, funny comedy‚Äîbut out of nowhere, it takes a brutal turn. It‚Äôs not just about being rich or poor; it‚Äôs about the invisible line between two classes living under the same sky, yet in completely different worlds. Bong Joon-ho doesn‚Äôt tell a typical story‚Äîhe gives you this strange mix of sympathy and guilt. You laugh, but you kind of feel bad for it. You sympathize, then realize you were rooting for the wrong side. And that massacre at the end? Totally unexpected‚Äîit hit hard.

PARASITE (2019) is exactly what its title suggests, only you're never entirely sure who's the leech, and who's the host. That‚Äôs part of its brilliance. Your perceptions are constantly being toyed with, in one moment rooting for those at the bottom of the food chain, while in another moment weirdly sympathizing with those who occupy the spacious top. It is clear, however, that the dynamics between upper and lower classes are ever-evolving, swinging back and forth, trading places in a system that eats its own and starves them from ever filling their financial bellies. It's a mean, scandalous examination of class rage by way of Bu√±uel, the way it pits poverty against affluence and draws you into its cockroach-ridden, Battle Royale standoff. Could have been a little more lean and less overstuffed, but this rotten parable of class inequity largely works through the home invasion genre to deliver a creepy thriller that bites, and social commentary that stings.

2024-01-02,5.0,"Parasite is one of the greatest films that I have ever watched. I have been wanting to watch this film for a while, and I am extremely glad that I did. Bong Joon-Ho deserved all of those Oscars for sure. The amount of dedication and hard work is definitely present in this film. Additionally, there are many factors on why Parasite is a masterpiece.
One factor that truly stands out to me about this film has to be the screenplay. The screenplay of this film was well written and paced. To talk more in depth about the plot, Parasite introduces us to the Kim family, who are struggling to keep themselves financially stable. They live in a worn down, one floor home and have to rely on free Wi-Fi to get internet. The Kim family is only able to earn money from folding pizza boxes and selling them. However, a great opportunity happens when Ki-woo‚Äôs friend, Min, suggests him for a job. Since Min is leaving to study abroad, he needs him to help tutor this young girl named Da-hye. The way that this plan will work is Ki-woo‚Äôs sister using her skills to photoshop the correct documents and identification to prove himself. Next, as he arrives at the house, he is greeted by the housekeeper. This family‚Äôs house is known as the Park family. Their house is extremely lavish with numerous rooms and modernistic architecture. He is able to meet Da-hye's mother, who is extremely kind towards him. She wants to experience his lesson, so she goes in and watches the process. As she sees that Ki-woo is an amazing tutor, she gives him extra money. The next day, he explains that he has a cousin who can tutor her son as well. This just leads to each family member playing a part in earning more money. It was so creative that this was their way of tricking the Park family. The plot of this film is just so intriguing because it has so much tension and suspensefulness. The slow buildup for the downfall of the Park family was paced perfectly. Additionally, I want y'all to just watch this plot play out, so I won't talk about the film anymore. The reason why I love this film so much is because every scene is crucial, and you can see how perfectly each character is written.
Another factor that I loved about Parasite has to be its beautiful set of characters. One of my favorite performances of this film has to be Kang ho Song's portrayal of Kim Ki-Taek. As being the father of his family, he wanted to make sure that his family would never have to live in these conditions again. You could see that during moments of tension, his facial expressions were great in highlighting these emotions. The way he was able to use his skills especially with body language added more to the suspense of this film. Another performance that I loved had to be Lee Sun-kyun's portrayal of Park Dong-ik. It was pretty intriguing that he was a CEO of an IT company. I loved the way he delivered his lines because it was so calm. I felt that since he was rich, he had more of this calmer personality because he did not have to worry about much in his life. The last performance that I loved in this film had to be Cho Yeo-jeong's portrayal of Park Yeon-kyo. It was just crazy to see her character in this film. She was extremely nice towards the Park family, and it later resulted in many negative consequences. There are so many other characters and acting performances that I loved in this film, but these are my top three for sure.
The last factor that I loved about this film had to be the gorgeous cinematography and practical effects/set design. To start out with the cinematography, there are so many shots that bring this film onto another level. Some of my favorite shots have to be the wide shots, the close ups, and the group shots. The wide shots highlighted a greater perspective in many scenes. An example of the wide shots that I loved had to be when a certain character would be hiding on the stairs. It was a way to emphasize that they were eavesdropping. This was especially frequent in the Kim family members because they were trying to figure out ways to earn money and live in better conditions. Another shot that I loved had to be the close ups. I loved seeing the range of emotions from happy, frightened, nervous, and shocked. The close up shot of Kim-ki Taek during the birthday party was so influential to the film. The surprised look on his face just added more tension because I did not expect certain events to happen at the end. The remaining scenes were just so shocking to me because it was a pretty big plot twist. Additionally, my last favorite shots have to be the group shots. These types of shots usually have multiple people in it, but I felt that these shots were more impactful when they showed both families. You could see the clear difference because of class separation and the income comparisons. When you see shots of the Kim family, you can see that they are much poorer. The place that they live in is more run down because of the worn out walls, small rooms, and dirty floors. On the other hand, when you look at the Park family, you can see how lavish their lifestyle is. Their house had many rooms, the technology was modern, and the rooms they had looked beautiful. You can see that this film focuses on social disparities and how different social classes live, which is extremely important to see. To talk about the practical effects though, the set design is just beautiful. I loved seeing the city of Seoul, the Kim family's house, and the Park family's house as well. The city of Seoul had different parts including a bustling city and the poorer side, which was where the Kim family lived. The house that they lived in was a great way to focus on the difficulties of living in a place like that. The house that the Park family looked majestic, including the wonderful architecture, security systems, and a fancy kitchen as well. Once y'all watch this film, you will see why these elements are important.
Overall, Parasite is one of my favorite films and such a fantastic watch for the new year. The screenplay was just outstanding and written perfectly. The characters are filled with so many unique qualities and the cinematography is just out of this world. I loved how their chemistry tied in all together to create this wonderful character dynamic for the film itself. Bong Joon-ho is such an amazing director, and I can't wait to see his upcoming film, Mickey-17 with Robert Pattinson. I definitely need to watch his other films. Additionally, I just received the 4K Blu Ray for this film masterpiece, and I cannot wait to watch this on my 4K TV as soon as possible. This is a film that y'all must watch, every aspect of it is just so perfect.

2020-04-26,4.5,"""Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you'll be introduced to so many more amazing films."" - Bong Joon-ho
This movie is fantastic and perhaps one of the best films of the past decade. Boon Joon-Ho successfully creates a full twist of genre halfway through the movie. Parasite is a great comedy for the first half of the film, and an even better crime/thriller for the second half of the movie. This movie is also an intelligent commentary on class and money. The different aspects of showing what each family stands for and what they prioritize is fascinating. Joon-Ho keeps the momentum going so well during this film, which makes the pacing perfect. The plot and story are so engaging you'll never want to take your eyes off the screen. All the performances were spot on, and the cinematography was stunning.
I had two favorite scenes from this film. The Belt of Faith (peach fuzz montage) montage was executed so flawlessly. The scene included the final plan of the family taking over the Park family by eliminating the current staff. The music playing during the montage is the cherry on top as it fits in so well. Da-Song's impromptu birthday party is my other favorite scene from the film. The killing frenzy caught me entirely off guard. That scene was both chilling and insane. However, while I felt the need to feel bad for the Park family, I didn't. Movies like Parasite will make you feel all sorts of emotions and will leave you thinking about it for a long time.
Something I picked up on while rewatching was the symbolism of the stone that was given to Kevin by Min. He holds onto the stone because he claims that it clings to him. And in the end, the stone is what nearly kills him. Many details can be observed when rewatching the film. Boon Joon-Ho deserved all the awards that were presented to him for this film. Parasite is an excellent film that everyone should watch at least once in their life. Parasite's conclusion is what started as a comedy of manners and transforms into a furious growl of rage as one of the most arresting social satires yet."

(Disclaimer: You may have heard that this film got leaked online, full subtitles and all, not very long ago. Before you ask, yes, that's how I watched it. Even if my reception to it wasn't as glowing as most others, as you're about to hear, if this does play in a theater near me during its official theatrical release, I will be more than happy to pay to see it on the big screen.)
The best way I can describe Parasite, though it may seem a tad unfair, is it being a mirror version of last year's Burning. The correlation is strong, to me at least. Both are South Korean films that begin as dramas, become thrillers, and are all about class struggle. The reputation of director Bong Joon-ho precedes him, and I was more than looking forward to this since it not only won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes, but it's also now one of the highest rated films on Letterboxd and IMDb not just of this year, but in general. No better way to hype a film up than to see every review for the film using the term ""masterpiece"" at least once. To the claims of Parasite being a masterpiece, I have to respond with ""Huh?""
Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this my fair share, and there's enough really good stuff in here for Bong to be more than happy with his creation. That being said, I also can't help but feel that the explorations of class and family didn't have as much impact on me as was intended. Despite, akin to the first half of Burning, time being focused on the lead characters from both families, I could've benefited from having a bit more characterization. I understood everyone's lifestyles very clearly, but who the Kims and the Parks were as people wasn't as clear. (I'll also say, in slight contrast to this, that everyone's performances are very solid. It's more of a problem I have with the writing than how it's presented.) That being said, without diverging into spoilers, there is a ""twist"" that happens smack dab in the middle where the film switches genres. From then on out, I will admit that I was hooked. I think my main disconnect is, unlike with Burning, that second half didn't feel as natural or earned.
I do feel like if I had to recommend one or the other, Burning is the film that's more worth your time, and it is a shame it didn't get the kind of massively warm and wide attention Parasite is getting. However, if you did love this film, and it seems as though the vast majority of people did, good on you. The first half of the film is a 6/10, the second half is an 8/10, and I'll give the film as a whole a few more pointers towards the latter than the former, because the second half on its own is pretty damn good through and through. (A lot of what makes that second half work initially is not knowing that it's coming, so avoid spoilers for this film, as much as you can. In contrast, maybe next time I see this, since I now know how the whole story goes, perhaps I'll enjoy it all a little more. We'll see.) If there is anything I enjoyed entirely with Parasite, it's the stellar musical score from Jaeil Jung. At times poetic in melody, and at other times intimidating, it's the film at its best told through music. A code.

Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a very rare film. It is timely, it seems to have emerged from the deep psychology of a culture in crisis, but without exhibiting cheap didacticism or stereotypes. It presents characters who are formed by their milieu but not wholly inscribed by it, individuals whose actions are, in the Brechtian sense, ""typical"" of their class position, but aren't without conflicting desires, regret, ambivalence. Parasite is both about the untenable hyper-division between the rich and poor, and the fact that a coming revolution -- lining all those one-percenters against the wall, as it were -- would be a sad, ugly business.
""I would be nice too if I were rich."" That's how the perpetually cranky Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) responds to her husband Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) when he comments that the Parks, the wealthy family they are conning, are actually very nice people. Their son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is connected with the Park family by an old school friend, Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon). This is the first moment that Parasite introduces not only class disparity but the basic lie of meritocracy. Ki-woo was the best English student in their class, but could not afford to go to college. Nevertheless, with Min-hyuk's recommendation, Ki-woo is employed by Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) to serve as the English tutor for their daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so).
Through various machinations, Ki-woo's entire family is eventually employed by the Parks. This process is rather schematic, and can lead the viewer to expect a somewhat formulaic black comedy wherein each of the family members is discovered in turn as an impostor. What actually happens is much more intriguing. Entry into the Parks' world introduces a heightened class awareness in the Kim family. They are all, for the most part, given the chance to excel within their chosen positions, something none of them has really had before. But this poses a question. Why do the Parks have such a comfortable life while the Kims live in squalor? What makes these people better?
Ki-woo and Da-hye begin a relationship, even as Ki-woo knows that it cannot last. Ki-taek develops complex feelings toward his employers, taking a not-so-secret shine to the Mrs., and trying to be a bit too familiar with Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun). And when a major revelation places the Kims, especially Chung-sook, in a precarious position where they might sympathize with another poor couple in desperate straits, Chung-sook instead decides to try and gain leverage over them, with horrible results.
It is no accident that the relationship between the Parks and the Kims begins with the children. They are the least inculcated into rigid class definitions, so there is the possibility that they can see each other as equals. But Mr. Park knows immediately that Mr. Kim is a poor man. When he thinks Ki-taek cannot hear, he tells his wife that his driver smells like a boiled rag, the sort of smell that only old homeless people have. This is the point at which, despite all his efforts and goodwill, Ki-taek knows that he will never belong to this world, even as a servant.
""I would be nice too if I were rich."" Chung-sook's words resonate as a kind of statement of purpose, but Bong shows us that even having contact with the sort of niceness that the Parks represent is enough to bring out the meanness in the Kims -- selfishness and ultimately murderous instincts that the rich can sublimate or abstract away into harsh monetary policy or job cuts. It's not only a question of who gets to keep their hands clean and whose must get irredeemably dirty. It's the fact that violence, in its many forms, begets violence, but only certain forms of violence are available to certain class positions.
The title, Parasite, is never literally explained in the film. I like the fact that this English title is easily misread as ""paradise,"" a play on both the imagined perfection of the life of the wealthy, and the post-revolutionary promise of a workers' paradise. But more than this, I think that Bong means to show that it's not just the Kims infiltrating the Parks' home (which of course has already been compromised), but the Parks penetrating the Kims' own psyches, burrowing into their sense of identity and entitlement.
Some have suggested that Parasite is a darker version of Hirokazu Kore-eda's Shoplifters, but the film I think Parasite most resembles is Kurosawa's masterpiece High and Low. That film depicted the futility of class resentment and the basic nobility of the rich, even though its characters had to go through various psychological calisthenics to arrive there.
But Parasite ups the ante, because the idea of a smoothly functional society is no longer plausible, or desirable. Put another way, what happens when the threat is internal, when the call, so to speak, is coming from inside the house? Parasite is the prelude to what, in its own universe, looks like a senseless killing. But in fact, the payback has just begun."
2019-09-18,5.0,"Just as the Kims attach themselves to the Parks, Parasite latches on to you and takes advantages of your ignorance of its transformative nature it has in store by gripping you for the first section of its runtime with an original premise which creates room for elaborate dark humour and suspense. Bong Joon-ho utilizes the normal world of both families and defines them so impeccably as the movie ever so often falls back on the characteristics of each individual at a later, more crucial point in time to draw the story towards an unforeseen direction. The immaculate cinematography captures the scenery of the two drastically contrasting households as the Kim family gradually infests their counterpart, benefiting from their gullibility as their living standards start to increase. The process of the parasite slowly acquiring and taking away resources from his host is figuratively presented in a grounded, credible way and realized with a pacing that keeps Parasite brisk.
It juggles with your expectations, though exceeds them in ways you would never imagine, particularly after the midpoint which relinquishes the prior premise, the humorous tone and morphs into an intense, unsettling thriller. With this unexpected tonal shift, the parasite itself is altering. Each member of the Kim family is changed internally by certain events, both shaping their character and leading right into an explosive Third Act ala Tarantino. The massacre however originates from subtly planted seeds, resulting in an emotionally, gruesome Climax.
Parasite is unlike everything else I have yet seen.

2025-03-10,4.5,"Been so long since I last watched it, man I missed it so much!
I was not technically part of the hype train for this back in the day. Of course I loved it and still considered it one of the best films from a year of great cinema. But that‚Äôs the thing, I just found more value in other cinema, The Lighthouse and Uncut Gems especially. So rewatching it years later now that the hype has severely quieted down, it still hits incredibly hard. 
I‚Äôve always respected its style and how I‚Äôve never been able to truly classify what genre it belongs to. It‚Äôs a little bit dramatic, a little bit comedic, heck even horrific (the shot of the guy looking from the basement stairs like holy crap even third time around I found it real spooky). But even if I can‚Äôt narrow it down I‚Äôm exhilarated nonetheless. Because the story and editing and characters and cinematography and everything keep me engaged. 
Worth being obnoxious over, it truly has and always will be that good."

2023-03-21,5.0,"Absolutely brilliant. It was amazing to finally revisit this film since seeing it for the first time in cinemas. It's been long enough that I forgot some of the events that transpire, but I also got to revel on the excellence I did remember. Everything is operating at such a high level and it's all so finely tuned. Some of the standouts for me include the stunning direction, cinematography, production design and the script, which was funnier than I remembered. All the performances as well are so damn great. The casting is perfection. I think Cho Yeo-jeong as the Park mother was my favourite, she's hilarious. Exploration of the themes are also done so well. For instance, how rainfall was later seen as a blessing for the wealthy Park family, while the Kims are trudging through chest high sewer water losing what little they had. And they had to show up for work the next day! Insane. A modern masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho. Respect!"

Second review
Third review
I introduced my younger brother to Korean cinema and for that I chose the obvious entry point. He loved the film, which doesn¬¥t surprise me, since I know that he loves movies with unpredictable twists and turns (oh, he will love Korean cinema).
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Well, everything has been said about ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù and I can only repeat my praise for the excellent blending of genres, mastery over tone and atmosphere, technical brilliance in all areas of filmmaking, symbolism, foreshadowing, thematic depth and sharp social commentary, story structure and pacing, incredible entertainment and rewatch value, and the stellar cast. Song Kang-ho is one of the greatest actors alive and Cho Yeo-jeong¬¥s performance is underrated in my opinion (she is such an integral part of the movie), but on every watch my favorite is Park So-dam. I love her and want to see more of her. For some reason, the shot of her smoking a cigarette while sitting on the overflowing toilet is my favorite shot of the movie (and there are many iconic shots in this film). My favorite scene has to be the whole peach montage, it¬¥s peak cinema. Furthermore, the house of the rich family is a top 10 movie house of all time. It¬¥s basically a character of its own.
I¬¥ve finally bumped up my rating to the full 5 stars. ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù is one of the best movies of the century so far and every rewatch is as enthralling as the first time while also always revealing something new."

It had a shit ton of hype and i finally came around to watching it and man, this movie is insane. It has some of the best cinematography of 2019 and some outstanding performances from its amazing cast. 
I never expected to like this movie as much as i did and i‚Äôm mad at myself for not watching it sooner. 
i‚Äôd definitely recommend this movie to anyone. As for top 2019 movies, this is definitely in the top 5. 
Also, jesus the last half hour of this movie was insane.

2025-02-20,5.0,"UNA VERDADERA OBRA MAESTRA. Bong Joon Ho realmente se empe√±√≥ en construir una tremenda historia alrededor de una familia de clase baja que se arrastran a tomar una vida que no les corresponde.
Es incre√≠ble la forma en que la trama toca tantos g√©neros y cada uno le funciona excelente; desde ser una comedia hacia la percepci√≥n ignorante del privilegio, un drama de pobreza en la que el clasismo orilla a las peores emociones o hasta el terror que puede causar vivir una vida llena de carencias y bajas expectativas por estar atado a la miseria.
Qu√© incre√≠ble gui√≥ooon, todo el tiempo te lleva de las risas a la tensi√≥n e incomodidad de una forma muy impredecible con un gran ritmo para llegar a un finalazo de completa desolaci√≥n.
Tambi√©n dest√°candose mucho la cinematograf√≠a poniendo a los personajes pobres por debajo de los ricos y ni hablar de las tremendas actuaciones. ü™®

2025-02-09,5.0,here's how parasite can win best picture again this year
2025-01-01,5.0,"‚ÄúIsso √© t√£o metaf√≥rico.‚Äù
O que dizer de Parasita? Este √© aquele tipo de filme que te faz refletir profundamente sobre diversas quest√µes sociais, como desigualdade, privil√©gios e os erros que atravessam gera√ß√µes. Para j√° come√ßar o ano bem pensando em quanto o nosso sistema falha miseravelmente.
Lembro de ter visto uma parte do filme quando era menor. Na √©poca, achei chato e sa√≠ no meio, j√° que n√£o consegui captar a mensagem. Estava assistindo com minhas primas, que eram mais velhas e entendiam melhor. Revisitar Parasita hoje, com outra perspectiva, foi uma experi√™ncia √≥tima. Agora consigo enxergar sua genialidade, √© uma obra impec√°vel, onde cada elemento est√° perfeitamente alinhado √† mensagem que quer transmitir.
Tudo no filme tem significado ‚Äì desde os di√°logos cuidadosamente constru√≠dos at√© o espa√ßo f√≠sico, como a casa dos Park, que foi projetada pelo pr√≥prio diretor, Bong Joon-ho. O homem √© um g√™nio, e Parasita n√£o √© superestimado nem um pouco. Cada pr√™mio conquistado ‚Äì Oscar de Melhor Filme, Melhor Dire√ß√£o, a Palma de Ouro dentre outros ‚Äì √© absolutamente merecido.
‚ÄúHoje o c√©u est√° t√£o azul e sem polui√ß√£o. Gra√ßas √† toda a chuva de ontem.‚Äù
Essa frase mostra perfeitamente a ess√™ncia do filme, revelando de forma sutil a desigualdade que separa as classes sociais. Para a Sra. Park, o c√©u limpo √© um benef√≠cio, fruto de um evento natural que trouxe conforto e beleza. J√° para Kim Ki-taek e sua fam√≠lia, a mesma chuva foi destrutiva, devastando o pouco que possu√≠am.
Esse contraste evidencia as ""linhas invis√≠veis"" que dividem os ricos dos pobres, um tema que Parasita aborda com uma precis√£o √∫nica. O final me doeu, o filme inteiro, na verdade, mas o final, quando mostra o filho rico comprando a casa e depois vemos que aquilo foi s√≥ sua imagina√ß√£o, √© como uma facada, j√° que ele provavelmente n√£o conseguiu.
A fotografia √© linda e as atua√ß√µes excelentes! Resumindo, o filme √© perfeito.
‚ú¶. ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ãÑ
English :
‚ÄúThat's so metaphorical.‚Äù
What can I say about Parasite? It‚Äôs the kind of movie that makes you deeply reflect on various social issues, such as inequality, privilege, and the mistakes that span generations. Starting the year with a film like this really makes you think about how miserably our system fails.
I remember watching part of the movie when I was younger. At the time, I found it boring and left halfway through because I couldn‚Äôt grasp its message. I was watching it with my older cousins, who understood it better. Revisiting Parasite today, from a more mature perspective, was an incredible experience. Now, I can appreciate its genius; it‚Äôs an impeccable work where every element is perfectly aligned with the message it aims to convey.
Everything in the movie has meaning ‚Äì from the carefully crafted dialogues to the physical spaces, like the Park family‚Äôs house, which was designed by the director himself, Bong Joon-ho. The man is a genius, and Parasite is far from overrated. Every award it received ‚Äì the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director, the Palme d‚ÄôOr, among others ‚Äì was absolutely well-deserved.
‚ÄúToday the sky is so blue and pollution-free. Thanks to all the rain yesterday.‚Äù
This sentence perfectly captures the essence of the film, subtly revealing the inequality that divides social classes. For Mrs. Park, the clear sky is a blessing, a result of the rain that brought comfort and beauty. For Kim Ki-taek and his family, the same rain was catastrophic, destroying the little they had.
This contrast highlights the ""invisible lines"" that separate the rich from the poor ‚Äì a theme that Parasite explores with remarkable precision. The ending broke me ‚Äì the whole film, actually ‚Äì but the ending especially, when it shows the rich son buying the house, only for us to realize it was just his imagination. It felt like a stab in the back because he probably never achieved that dream.
The cinematography is stunning, and the acting is phenomenal! In short, this film is perfect."
2024-11-03,5.0,"Watching this for a second time made it even better and showed just how incredible that this movie actually is.
Parasite has a complicated and multi-levelled plot and yet it is still displayed in a way that makes it unbelievably easy to understand it on almost every level. It is extremely well written and shows many different perspectives on the way that society views wealth and family.
Many films exist today that require lots of youtube videos etc afterward that help people understand it more, but I feel that Parasite manages to show you everything it is doing while you watch it.
The ending is immaculate and, somehow, satisfying on every single level.
While it is immensely sad, they also somehow make it quite funny and I can see why it is viewed as a comedy movie. This just shows how incredible the writing really is."

No joke, this is without a doubt one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Beyond making me physically shake in suspense, the impact it has left on me is indescribable.

What an amazing win!! About a week ago I went to a Q&A and world premiere of the B&W version of Parasite.
I asked Bong ""What is the most important advise you could give to young filmmakers?"" He replied: ""Be satisfied with oneself."" Well I hope he can be satisfied now with himself. He has indeed made a great film. An instant classic. Congrats BONG JOON-HO!!!

2019-11-06T02:40:33.142Z,5.0,"My old school (Illinois State University) getting namedropped in this movie... rather unanticipated by me.
Those that read my scathing review of Terminator: Dark Fate may wonder why I went and saw a dumb Hollywood product that I suspected would be dumb when there are independent movies I could be checking out instead... touche, I say. Central Florida is not like Los Angeles or New York... but various indie/foreign movies usually don't require too long a drive to see. As I mentioned while talking about Dark Fate, some of those pictures do come off as pretentious and even a little bit intolerable to me. Snowpiercer was a big letdown for me, yet The Host was a very good Bong Joon-ho movie so I was hoping I would agree with most film fans and think this was worth checking out theatrically. As you can see with my highest of scores, no one has to get out the pitchforks and hang me in the town square! Those elsewhere around the world, it was only this past Friday that Parasite made it to mainstream cineplexes in the United States and is in more than select locations. I understand that many people got to see this months ago.
I never even saw a trailer for this so I only went into the picture hearing that it dealt with a pair of families, one rich and the other poor, and those two interact with each other. That is indeed correct, and I'll attempt to be vague here to avoid giving away anything important. Naturally, the poor family is desperate so they do some things to try and help themselves-this includes a few little white lies-but... unexpected complications occur. Parasite has plenty of content concerning inequality between the haves and have nots, along with capitalism in general and ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù... this is done as various genres are mixed in together. I'll just say that there are laughs of the satirical and dark humor variety along with some suspenseful moments and yeah, a few bloody ones also.
Perhaps Parasite is benefiting, re: that it was the first thing I viewed after experiencing something I found to be awful... be that as it may, I was very happy to see something that was unpredictable yet not ludicrous or devoid of logic... a picture where the audience can decide how they feel about the various main characters, as nothing is black or white and you can damn the rich family for being naive or not comprehending how ‚Äúcommon folk‚Äù live... or knowing at least once that things are likely to go wrong... you just don't know when or how this will occur.
I haven't viewed all of the director's movies by any means but this is the best and favorite that I have seen; what a ride this was. I was very happy to see something original that did not insult my intelligence or was overly smug or was way too arch for me to enjoy. Everything about the movie was great, from the story and the performances to the cast and everything behind the camera; if you enjoy what Bong does or even if you want to see a story that deftly maneuvers between several different genres and can view this theatrically... Parasite is a must-see."

2019-08-09,5.0,"Well, I'm drinking the Kool-Aid on this one.
What a masterwork of cinema!
I'd say this is looking to be director's Bong Joon-ho best and most personal film he has made yet.
Without getting into specifics, this film reminded me a lot of a particular horror film directed by Wes Craven.
I'm not going to say which film of his it was, as I think if I were to name the movie, it would spoil things about this film.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
But I'm 99% sure you'll be able to identify which film of his it is after watching this, even if you haven't seen that said film.
Just watch the movie. I'll say no more fam.
It's so rightfully deserving on winning the Palme d'Or at this years Cannes Film Festival."
2025-04-04,5.0,"First half of the movie was straight-up cringe, but the second half- lowkey fire. Parasite really nails the whole rich vs. poor contrast.
Weather: Rain for the rich is an aesthetic. Rain for the poor is a life-ruining flood.
The real parasites: The title‚Äôs tricky‚Äîseems like the Kims are the leeches, but the rich folks are just as bad, living off the labor of the poor without even noticing.
The smell thing: The Parks clocked that all the Kims smelled the same‚Äîthat‚Äôs the scent of being broke.
The staircase: Literal social ladder. The higher you go, the better off you are. The basement is rock bottom, both figuratively and literally.
Ki-woo gets this so-called ‚Äúlucky stone‚Äù, but instead of wealth, it just wrecks him. Ditching it at the end is him letting go of false hope.
Why it‚Äôs called Parasite: Both families are feeding off each other. The Kims hustle to survive, but the Parks literally can‚Äôt function without the working class keeping their world running.
And that ending? Just a dream. Bro is never getting that house."
2025-02-24,5.0,"**Insert Martin Scorsese meme with his hands in the air saying This is Cinema**
Masterfully crafted and arguably the best original screenplay of the century. Bong Joon-ho is an absolute colossus of a filmmaker and has never missed. We also need to start talking more about Song Kang-ho as one of the finest actors alive. All the cast are great but he is the standout for me. One of my biggest loves for this film is the use of the visual storytelling, and how the shots and the editing tell a story in itself without any exposition. Its so clever the way they use the visual and spacial metaphors throughout.
Giving this 5 stars still feels like an understatement. If we had a sixth star option, this film would have it. Deserving of every single award and bit of praise it recieved.

2019-09-05,5.0,"Highest recommendation to see this movie before you know ANYTHING about it. Which makes it incredibly hard to review, actually. Bong Joon-ho's instincts for class struggle crisis points are so incredibly sharp here, but nothing, be it theme or aesthetic, steps in front of the storytelling here, as this grifter family plots to scam its way into wealth-adjacency. Brick by brick, this house gets assembled and then thrillingly, shockingly, horribly gets leveled. It's funny, pointed, and exhilarating, a daring cross-pollination where ""Shoplifters"" meets ""Gosford Park"" meets ""Us."" Easily one of the best of the year."
2019-08-12,5.0,"Masterful in every sense of the word. The entire film was a god-damn symphony. Whether it's the meticulously crafted scenes of horror, the pulsating thrills that are as excruciating and as brilliant as you'd expect with Korean cinema to the well-written social critiques and attitudes that Bong Joon-Ho so subtly pushes to the forefront of the film, you really can't knock it.
Parasite is smart, both on a film-making level and also within the confines of it's elaborate subtext. The uniqueness in which Joon-Ho delivers his work to us is a testament to his skill as an auteur. The guy is an absolute master and this is a wild film. I can't wait to watch it again.

‚ÄúWould you like to open the black box with me, Madame?‚Äù


<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Bitterness, contempt, disgust, rage. A polite smile turns into a look of envy. A calm composure erupts into something more manic. Seething rage bubbling under ones skin. It‚Äôs like a black box, containing all these repressed emotions. Emotions change so fast in an instant, to hide their true intentions. People would do anything to survive in this cruel world, it‚Äôs a matter of flight or fight, would you lie to get your way? Do you manipulate people through meticulous planning to get the upper hand? Or do you cower, submit to the suffocating class division? Submit to the fact that people have power over you?
Bong Joon Ho creates something so devilishly cunning, so darkly humorous, a suspense that makes you grip your seats. He has blended genres, mixed them together, forming a strange beast of his own. A beast that can‚Äôt be replicated. Something that no one but him can pull off. He‚Äôs a master at his own craft. Deceiving the audience, creating an underlying sexual tension, each scene going off at comical timing, creating satires that comment on societal issues. Ranging from, Class Anxiety, Socioeconomics, the incompetence of the police, the love of his parents. He has a grip on each story. When you think he is about to cross the line, he doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs simply the tell tale sign that you‚Äôre in a Masters hands.
Metaphorical symbols in each image, making it more thematically deep. Unpredictable fate, whatever plans you make, are all futile. Only time can tell, if you‚Äôre going to succeed or fail. The characters obsession with exterminating bugs. Parasitic behaviours from the Kims as they slowly start to wiggle themselves, like a bug into the Park‚Äôs lavish lifestyle. Perceptions twisted to show class division.
Each character, flawed, explored. Each one brazenly selfish or unsympathetic towards others. Some naive while kind. Some obsessed with certain things. Some seething with rage underneath a calm facade. We see foxes underneath sheep‚Äôs clothing. No one is unwilling to harm another person, be it psychologically or physically. Everyone is callous in their actions. Some unpredictably violent and conniving. After all, who doesn‚Äôt desire to live lavishly? Under a big roof, luxurious gleaming surfaces. Lush greenery that surrounds your house. After all, no one wants to live in a slum. 

If a film like Mother doesn‚Äôt cement Bong as an auteur, then Parasite will. He does anything to get a reaction out, be it gasps of shock, boisterous laughter, looks of anticipation even makes you reflect on societal issues. Blow after blow, one ironic contradiction after another, one metaphor being stacked upon each other, we have no choice but to admit (be it begrudgingly) that Bong has made something masterful. I doubt that another film this year would make me as astonished as Parasite."

On the surface the movie works due to an enjoyable cast of characters who get put through so many twists and turns in both comedic and shocking ways. Seeing them deal with these events is engaging to watch, but beyond the simplicity of the premise the entire movie is dripping with deeper meanings and subtext that enhances the themes without coming across as preachy which was an issue I had with Snowpiercer from the same director.

Watching years removed from the Bong hype, it‚Äôs really that amazing and a bowl of Ram-Don. 
Every performance, every calculated whip pan, every line of dialogue is as perfectly placed in the construct of the film you worry if there‚Äôs a false beat the film will crumble under the weight of it‚Äôs own craft but Bong somehow balances all these spinning plates effortlessly its mind-blowing, especially how he can seamlessly jump tones from comedy to drama to horror and back again with ease.

With great dark humor and a clever use of it's themes of classism and bigotry, absolutely great character building, beautiful cinematography, great dialouge and clever editing. As it starts everything seems pretty normal but then the more it goes on the more it just keeps taking you to different places you probably wont see coming and it's all the better for it."
2019-12-08,4.5,"Ooof.
Okay, I started writing a review of Parasite and it accidentally got eaten by letterboxd halfway through (the dangers of hitting the wrong key on the keyboard around here) so what you're getting is the slightly shorter, clumsier, more annoyed version of my reflection. Sorry! Which is to say, I was really struck by not only the decisions the characters made, but the decisions that they didn't make.
There's that scene that follows the family's celebration/drinking party in the living room while looking out at the lawn where the old housekeeper returns, and they discover that a) there's a sub-basement under the wine cellar b) the old housekeeper's husband has been hiding down there all this time c) she'd really like to continue the arrangement where the narrative and what it's been so far with the poor family gradually pulling the wool over the eyes of the rich family threatens to tear free, you can get the sense of the story potentially going in any direction......just like Kim Chung-sook, trying to deal with the sudden request from the former housekeeper and rejecting it-both families are desperate to defend their modest graft, both families are desperate to not rock the boat too much, to just use the Parks enough to give themselves....a better share of the bare minimum? The old housekeeper upbraids the Kims for not having any imagination, for just sitting there drinking and watching the lawn when she sees the evidence of their party laid out in the living room, but her own plan (pay off the new housekeeper, get food delivered to her husband in the basement on a regular basis so he can keep living tucked away in his little cave below the world) is a pretty depressing arrangement in its own right (mildly less depressing than being caught by his creditors would be, I suppose)
And when the deal is rejected out of fear, out of pride or a sense of a family marking their territory, saying that the rich family is ours and we're not going to share, it's what sparks the dissolution of both families that follows, the attempt to hold on to the Park's house at all costs for both of them triggering a chain of events that leads to one family completely destroyed, and the other broken, reduced in number and back where they started, in the basement, with the son planning out a new life that involves immersing himself in the system that's destroyed his life in order to connect with his father again in the house that's come to exert such control over both their lives throughout the film.
There's a real sense that things could have gone very differently, especially in the second half of the film, is what I'm saying, but the characters are constrained-by their egos maybe, by their fear, by their ability to create unnecessary enemies in their desire to join a family that Mr. Kim realizes (tragically, too late) will never see them as equals, lacks the most basic of common ground.
So yeah, I keep coming back to that scene in the basement, and Mrs Kim putting her foot down and refusing to help out the old housekeeper, the characters inability to work together. It dovetails with Kim's speech to his children in the shelter later in the film, after their basement's flooded, where he gives the 'You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all' speech, and it suddenly becomes clear that the same fear that's kept him alive and made him a survivor, the same fear that makes him unwilling to develop any sort of long term plan or see any vision more than 'grift your way into a good job and sit around in your bosses' house drinking alcohol and staring at the lawn' as unrealistic -that determined short-term approach to thinking is what eventually dooms his family to being where they are at that birthday party and leads him back into the basement where he's a prisoner at the end of the film, having replaced the old housekeeper's husband and spending his nights punching out morse code in the hopes that his son sees it, and that's the overwhelming sense I'm left with--it didn't have to be that way.
It could have been different.
Should have been, even."

Money is an iron with which one can smooth out all wrinkles. Class war in a different way. Social imbalance is certainly not a new topic for director Bong Joon-ho. Already his dystopian comic adaptation Snowpiercer was dedicated to the gap between rich and poor, but Parasite now shifts this conflict to contemporary Seoul. Initially, not only in terms of content, but also in terms of clear visual separation between those up there and those down there. But the borders are soon to become permeable and ultimately blurred. Here the Kim family between folded pizza boxes and the unencrypted WLAN of the neighbour in a cellar hole, there the Park family between wine rack and housekeeper in the huge house of a star architect.
Joon-ho has already realized many great movies: Memories of Murder, The Host or Mother for example, but Parasite is his masterpiece so far. Extremely precise and with an open mind he dissects the social imbalances piece by piece, yet never succumbs to the temptation to moralize. He does not judge, but only depicts and fully trusts the viewer to draw his own conclusions. Thus, Joon-ho doesn't only send his characters, but especially the viewer with his exaggerated as well as equally pointed and clever parable through a rollercoaster of emotions.
Tonally, Parasite changes its mood at will and is sometimes slapstick, sometimes drama, sometimes thriller and then again comedy, is bitterly angry, weird, deeply sad, thrilling, hilarious, shocking, surprising and most of all: always completely unpredictable. Not one twist, not one narrative trick did I see coming and there are some of them to marvel at. The plot is both changeable and unpredictable, can book strong changes of perspective for itself and offers a lot of critical subtext, yet at the same time comes along with a sometimes almost playful lightness, that is second to none.
Formally, everything is just right here and Parasite is flawless in its entire staging down to the very last detail, no matter how small. Joon-ho really shows all his skills, because despite the spatial limitation of the setting his movie looks breathtakingly good, stands out with an enormous visual elegance and delivers one perfectly composed picture after the other. Timing and pacing are brilliant, when every punch line, every twist, yes, even every sentence is exactly in the right place. Nothing is left to chance here, but every second seems completely organic and anything but artificial.
Parasite is a wild and surprisingly well-functioning genre mix between social criticism and class struggle, but knows no winners, only gradations of loss. Joon-ho wanders effortlessly between slapstick and thriller, between bitter satire and dark horror, between fleeting dreams and harsh reality, between life at the subsistence level and life in abundance. What ultimately remains is the image of a downpour of indescribable proportions, which for some cleans the air and streets, but for others could mean the extinction of their entire existence. Just like that and nobody would be interested.
No other film this season has been able to fascinate me so much, to carry me away, to entertain me and at the same time make me think. Every Oscar is well deserved!"

‚Ä¢ Can you believe that, at one point, I actually thought that Parasite could possibly be less rewarding on a second viewing? Curse me! 
‚Ä¢ This is still literally the fastest paced movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Breezy content.

‚Ä¢ After people see Parasite, the peach emoji will no longer be seen as a symbol for ‚Äúgetting some cake‚Äù *wink wink* but it will, more or less, be a message you send to threaten someone. Thanks, Bong.
‚Ä¢ Between this and Park Chan-wook‚Äôs Oldboy, Parasite may have the most enthralling climax of ALL-TIME. Korean filmmakers, am I right?
‚Ä¢ You know the old saying that ‚Äúless is more‚Äù and ‚Äúsimplicity is complexity?‚Äù In response to those phrases, Parasite was like, ‚ÄúNAHHHHHH.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ I appreciated the twist significantly more on this revisit. It just fits so snug with the themes of this movie. 
‚Ä¢ Even Alfred Hitchcock would‚Äôve been like, ‚ÄúDAMNNNNNNNNNNNN.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ I fucking love this movie more than I love my love for movies. YEAH. I KNOW.

2025-04-27,5.0,"I don't even know where to begin without resorting to superlatives - but Parasite completely blew me away. It's one of those films that, after the credits roll, you just stay seated, not just because of the impact of what you've just experienced, but because you feel like you've just seen something truly special.
What Bong Joon-ho does here feels almost effortless: a film so stylistically polished that you could frame every shot, yet thematically so dense and precise that you'll be left breathless. It moves through genres as if through spaces - seamlessly, playfully, yet always with a deep seriousness at its core.
What impressed me most is how much Parasite says without pointing the finger. There's so much observation, so much quiet anger, but also so much humor and humanity in every scene. The film never feels contrived, but alive - sometimes uncomfortably close, sometimes strangely familiar.
For me, this is cinema at its best: a mirror, a window, a punch in the stomach and a hug all at once."

2021-02-03,5.0,"It‚Äôs my 17th birthday, so I decided to watch Parasite for a third time and here‚Äôs my thoughts:
Bong Joon-Ho is a masterful director and in Parasite he reflects this in every aspect. It‚Äôs a thriller film where every single detail is foreshadowed yet never truely is in the audiences peripheral vision until the climax of the film. Where it comes together in such a surreal and almost dreamlike way. I say this because this part of the film is so dark, yet utilises very light colours making it very uneasy.
It‚Äôs a film about class divide and the way it uses two very distinct symbolic elements to display this divide is genius. You may already know these but I still can‚Äôt get over how genius they are. In dialogue the ‚Äòline‚Äô between these two families is mentioned through the scent of the lower class. Through the cinematography and placement of characters shows a distinct line between both families, this placement creating a distinct line is a every interaction is a nice detail, showing this divide from the two families. The second being elevation, the upper class family lives at the top of the elevation, where the lower class sits at the the bottom, and the lower you go, the lower your class. The scene in the rain signifies this in the most heartbreaking way.
It‚Äôs masterful, the writing elevates all the characters, as it‚Äôs witty and has a lot of heart to it. It‚Äôs a movie with a ton of genres, but I like to call it genre less. The way the plot moves with every twist and turn until the final moment makes this a very fun and nail biting watch. 
The end is so bittersweet, you know Ki-woo will never buy the house or meet his dad yet just like Ki-woo you have a tiny glimpse of hope that this would happen. Don‚Äôt ask me why but on this watch the end made me cry. I still love this movie because of how much it says, and how it utilises its symbolism and characters.  This is never gonna get old.

2020-02-12,5.0,"Reviewed on Cinema Eclectica.
Hype is real. It used to be that when a non-Anglophone director worked in Hollywood then went back home, that was essentially an admission of failure, but both Park Chan-Wook and now Bong Joon-Ho have successfully kicked their careers up a notch by returning to South Korea and turning in something even stronger, more accessible yet more daring, than their still impressive English language films. Watching Parasite you can't help but think the success is merited. It's as tangy, nasty, formally precise, witty and twisty as anything he's done, and his shout-out to Scorsese in his Best Director acceptance speech feels like a man accepting the baton.
Criticism that it isn't empowering enough to its working-class characters isn't exactly wrong, just misguided. Bong doesn't make films to comfort or uplift and this is no exception. What he is saying is that the class system is an unwinnable game in which even the people who seem to have gotten ahead are made less human by their victory, and even the people who seem to be striving to escape it are tainted by their acceptance of it. It's not a realist film - although it is worth noting Bong was partly inspired by the story of the Papin sisters, the basis for Jean Genet's classic play The Maids - but it is very real."

2019-10-17,4.5,Just peachy
2019-09-08,4.0,"I may not have loved this AS much as most people did, but obviously it's pretty fantastic. Bong Joon-Ho is great and once again shows he's somewhat in a league of his own, even if just for his signature ""genre-mashing"" style of writing/filmmaking.
One moment you're laughing (you're actually doing that a lot, if I HAD to put it in a box, I'd call this a dark comedy (but the thing is, you don't have to, so it really doesn't matter)), the next moment you're gasping or just holding your breath because there's some sincerely good, tense set pieces. Plus, towards the end, it actually has quite a bit of heart to it. <3
As per ushe with Bong, you can read all kinds of social commentary into the story. Even though stuff like that is often somewhat lost on me, but obviously there's something going here with class, and wealth, and what not. Fortunately not as on the nose as in for example Snowpiercer, and the movie still works perfectly fine if you just take it at face value.
So yeah, greatly enjoyed this one, will definitely go back for another watch at some time."
2019-08-30,4.5,"It‚Äôs clear to me from the Korean cinema I‚Äôve had the pleasure of watching that there is a real interest in telling stories that revolve around social classes and the tensions that lie there when they collide. Parasite was able to find some compelling, unique pain, urgency, and humor in that dynamic unlike anything I‚Äôve seen before.
I was immediately drawn to this family that clearly come from a place without the means of their upper-class counterparts they stumble upon later on, but they use their cunning and wit to connive themselves into a better position. I especially love the use of technology as an accessible, invaluable tool they have at their disposal to aid in their scheming. Truly it is so interesting to see a less fortunate family being portrayed and intelligent and resourceful instead of self-pitying and depressed. They are the anti-heros, and they play those roles with grace.
The wealthy family on the other hand is shown to be naive, trusting and a bit out-of-touch with reality. Seeing them fall for trick after trick playing out blatantly in front of their faces makes for a suspenseful viewing, but also hilarious relief.
What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was for this film to take the turn it did into the real darkness. I won‚Äôt spoil it for anyone reading this review, so I‚Äôll be vague but it‚Äôs clear that Bong Joon Ho too extra care that the darkness works just as well as the light. That took it over the top for me.

2020-02-21,5.0,"It's the same film as the first time I saw it, yet I could feel something different as I pressed play on Parasite this time around. Something palpable, like it carried a different weight post-Oscars rather than just prior to the award ceremony when it was the underdog that surely wouldn't bust through as the first foreign film ever to win the top prize. It occurred to me how unfair this was, to view the same work of art in a different light simply because it received recognition that elevated it even higher than simply a work acclaimed critically and the first picture out of Korea to ever receive a nomination from the Academy, which is remarkable if you consider their rich history of cinema. I couldn't help but think of the box office success Parasite has received, specifically since Oscar night, with so many people seeking it out knowing that it had just swept the major categories of Original Screenplay, Director and Picture. Such lofty expectations created by the award season narrative, to sit in a theater not just expecting good nor great but the best. The good news is, if there is a film out there to rise to such expectations for an audience, a film that truly has something for everyone as it pleases both on a surface level and also with so much to say regarding income inequality and class warfare, Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is that picture. For me, with this second viewing cementing its place firmly, it truly was the best picture of 2019.
The opening shot of the film establishes where the Kim family stands in both a societal and literal sense, as the camera pans down from a set of windows which sit at ground level to a young man named Ki-woo Kim sitting in an apartment below. After a bit of dialogue that tells us everything we need to know regarding the economic situation of this family, as they search desperately for a location in their home that can access free WiFi, the patriarch of the Kim's (played brilliantly as usual by Song Kang-ho) spots a stink bug and flicks it away in disgust, and is welcome to the fumigators outside filling their home with a cloud of toxicity because, in their own words, ""Kill these stink bugs"" and ""Too many stink bugs these days"", which unbeknownst to them in this moment symbolizes their place in the class construct of society. To so many that both literally and figuratively reside above the Kim's, they are nothing more than stink bugs.
As previously stated and known to pretty much anyone who has either seen or knows even the basic construct of Parasite, it's a film about economic inequality and class, but it isn't as blatantly simple as a statement that rich people are evil and disregard or mistreat the poor. What we are seeing with this story is the disconnect between the upper and lower class when their worlds come together, in this case the Park family hiring the Kims as their help, although obviously this happens through manipulation and deceit from the Kims and the Park family has no idea the team they assembled are a family at all, which is wonderfully entertaining in the film, perfectly written and also a fascinating example of the desperation you find in those that are poverty stricken existing in a world in which their only option is to eat their own to try to stay afloat, a system designed in which some may have to do unethical and unfortunate things in order to try to catch up let alone get ahead. To the Park family, hiring people to be their help is just an expense, and they likely even feel they are doing a good thing, paying them a solid wage and believing they are treating their workers like family, yet when faced with a housekeeper stricken with a terrible illness they quickly remove and replace her and don't look back, all the while not knowing and seemingly not caring about the plight of the former housekeeper and her actual family. She was family until she wasn't, flicked away like a stink bug. Whether they are simply blind to the challenges of those beneath them or truly do not care is almost irrelevant as both are egregious, as ignorance is not an acceptable excuse to those struggling to survive.
I couldn't help but notice that at almost exactly the halfway point of Parasite, literally almost to the second, the twist of the story is revealed. I question whether that was coincidental or another example of sublime construction by Bong Joon-Ho, to have the first half of the film dabble with such playfulness and comedic bits with the subtext to the story always present, only to so bluntly hit the audience over the head with such a literal representation of the poor underneath the wealthy. We exit the clean, shiny aesthetic of the Park home to find the camera heading down ugly, dimly lit green tinted walls and that's when we find out the secret of what Parasite is all about.
What is so exciting about the production design of Parasite is how on the nose it all is but that transparency is brilliant. Some of the trappings of income inequality are subtle and nuanced, but a lot of the struggles are far more apparent in the real world. A lot of the world around us are drowning beneath those living so comfortably that they don't even have to dip their toes in the water. When the Kim family heads home in the driving rain and shot after shot after shot features a different staircase lit ominously as they continue to descend further and further, it's like they have entered an entirely different, utterly surreal world from where they just came from. That's how it actually feels to be left behind in society.
The final shot of the film is exactly like the first, a different backdrop outside as this time we see falling snow and the blanket it leaves behind but the windows are the same and the angle we see out of them is identical, along with the camera pan downward. Fortunes seemingly changed at times but in the end the result is the same. A young man named Ki-woo Kim living beneath the world after experiencing so much loss and trauma, dreaming of a future at the top. The opening moments after this shot at the beginning are filled with such a comedic energy despite their circumstances, but the final identical shot is a tragedy. Sounds about right for so many in this world."

I mean this left me speechless. I'm late to the party but I finally got around to watching this masterpiece that has swept the cinema scene for years now. One of the best thrillers to date and the shock value is high! The tension was real and is created brilliantly. The characters are well written and the cast was fantastic along with the story of course. It's beautifully shot and engaging while really grabbing your attention from the start. The attention to detail with every shot and dialogue is really special and appreciated. It's twisted and dark but has you laughing at other moments and truly original, unlike anything else. The use of stairs and elevation for a visual representation of class is genius. There are no wasted scenes, they are all important to the story and themes and definitely more rewarding on rewatches. Even if you don't care too much about the themes and deeper meanings, this film is so well shot and masterful that anyone can appreciate this masterpiece. This one had me sitting in silence through the credits in a ""holy shit that was an experience"" type of way.
If you're like me and put this on your watchlist in 2019 but still haven't watched it, close this review and enjoy!"

‚ÄúParasite‚Äù is well written. Funny. Stressful. Thrilling. Intoxicating. Incredible. Terrific. Brilliant. It's about social discrepancy between the rich and the poor. And yeah the title ""Parasite"" perfectly captures what this movie is all about. Just believe me, the hype is real !! You will laugh your ass off and later you might hold tight to your seat.
What an incredibly good film, such brilliance. It's hard to put into words."
2021-02-25,4.0,"Black and White edition.
Parasite is a fascinating film about the ever growing class divide we face ourselves in globally. It's certainly a choice to present the lower class family as the titular parasites, but it's ultimately the film's point, the rich may be condescendingly aloof, but that the poor have been left to turn on each other to stay afloat. Supposedly a black comedy, but honestly for me, too insane and morbidly chilling to laugh about. Even coming to this movie as comparatively late as I have, I'm beyond glad I was able to go in cold, this movie was definitely unpredictable and kept me on edge.
I'd rented this via Apple and they didn't mention anything about it being the black and white version, but I'm genuinely glad I got to see it that way. It feels like it adds another layer of morbidity to the film. Some of the exterior shots in town, especially around the flood feel like something out of the universal horror era. I'll absolutely have to check out the colour version, but to be honest, part of me feels like I'd be more content sticking with the black and white."

However, if you look past this and truly analyze the film you will find that, outside its solid pacing, well written, consistent characters, and unique story that manages to smoothly merge a comical and fun first half with a much more sinister and thrilling second half, there is little to like about this foreign feature. The fact that its final half hour manages to be quite unexpected despite its incredibly meticulous set up is also an achievement deserving of no recognition. Adding to these numerous failures is the fact that I couldn‚Äôt understand a single fucking word any of the characters were saying.

2019-12-07,4.5,"Bong Joon-ho en Parasite representa a la diferencia de clases sociales, y a los ejes geom√©tricos y simb√≥licos del film a partir de las ventanas de las dos familias.
El primer plano de la pel√≠cula muestra una ventana que da a la calle, el plano desciende y nos muestra a un joven con un celular buscando se√±al de Internet. Con ese descenso nos cuenta la clase social de la primera familia (baja) y con su forma nos muestra una pantalla como la del celular. Con un celular echar√°n a la mucama de la familia rica, esta los extorsionar√°, el joven se comunicar√° con su alumna y con su familia escondida. Un llamado por celular de la mujer de la familia rica interrumpe la pelea entre la pareja marginal y la familia marginal.
La ventana de la segunda familia es un gran ventanal que da a un jard√≠n. Con su tama√±o nos cuenta la clase social de la familia (alta) y con su forma nos muestra una pantalla como la del cine. Es adentro de esa casa, de esa pantalla, que la familia de clase baja har√° su pel√≠cula usando los recursos de la familia de clase alta. Interpretar√°n roles, previamente guionados y ensayados, que culminar√°n violentamente en el jard√≠n que da a la misma pantalla.
A su vez Bong Joon-ho llena obsesivamente cada encuadre de Parasite con formas rectangulares o cuadradas, algunos ejemplos: las cer√°micas y adornos de las paredes, las cajas de pizza, el ba√∫l que contiene la piedra 'metaf√≥rica', las mesas, los cuadros, el envase de k√©tchup, las hojas en donde el joven escribe los mensajes de y para su padre."

Rich people are parasites in our world, shrouding themselves in their own privilege - but the people they stand on top of are also the ones they cannot live without. Maybe it's a message that we've heard numerous times but it truly bears repeating.

It's not a conflict for people who live underground, get pissed over and have to hustle to simply get food on the table - like they're existences mattered less than those above, or worse, don't even register at all - whether or not to seize the opportunity to make a living at the expense of obscene accumulators of wealth. Society is pretty much structured around that exact process, only with the players in opposite positions (and it's not exactly a fair match). Having that covered, Bong Joon-ho can fully devote his immense talents for genre filmmaking on the 'how' of it all, the intricate mechanics and consequent genius writing/blocking of the actions taking place at the house. While that's happening, there's a constant and, more subdued (although far from hidden) preparation for the somewhat shocking developments in the story, which are curiously finally 'earned', so to speak, in a stretch that comes immediately after the most intensely exciting part of the picture, as if serving as the definite reminder of what all that entertainment ultimately comes down to.

It's not a conflict for people who live underground, get pissed over and have to hustle to simply get food on the table - like they're existences mattered less than those above, or worse, don't even register at all - whether or not to seize the opportunity to make a living at the expense of obscene accumulators of wealth.

After my first rewatch, I love this film even more than before. Everything just fits together perfectly. ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù is original, unique, and unpredictable. The most impressive aspect of the film is how smoothly it repeatedly switches between different genres and tones. Some parts are hilarious, others are exciting, suspenseful, dramatic, disturbing, shocking, or sad, and no scene feels out of place.
‚ÄúParasite‚Äù is a masterfully crafted work of art. It has a flawless pacing, fantastic score, brilliant‚Ä¶ more"

2024-05-29,4.0,"This film was completely different to what I thought it would be. I knew it would be good because of all of the high ratings and awards it got, and while yeah, it‚Äôs overrated, it was still a very good film. This movie definitely has a LOT of symbolism in it, different items and themes symbolising different things, which I really respected. I liked the idea of the film, the final few scenes were very shocking, and the ending was a little confusing but once I understood it, I liked it.
The title for this film is also perfect, along with the foreshadowing. I like how the film centres around social injustice and how both families can be seen as parasites. It‚Äôs a very original and unique film, but I do think it‚Äôs very overrated- like letterboxd‚Äôs number 8 film and a 97 Metascore is a bit too much. I did really respect and enjoy this film, but I think some people say it‚Äôs way better than what it is. 
Edit: After having a while to think about this film, I feel like it has quite a few issues and while I respect the film i‚Äôm honestly not the biggest fan- it‚Äôs a decent film but very overrated"
