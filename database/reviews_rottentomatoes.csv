1.0,"Jul 21, 2025","I genuinely have no idea why this movie is so popular. The acting is good, but the storyline and plot are boring. This movie is fuc*ing boring. What is wrong with people?"
5.0,"Jul 21, 2025",Fantastic. This is a great movie.
5.0,"Jul 19, 2025","Parasita te fisga j√° nos primeiros minutos e n√£o larga at√© o √∫ltimo frame. Bong Joon-ho mistura com√©dia e drama com maestria, mostrando a fam√≠lia Kim lutando por cada centavo enquanto cai de cara no universo luxuoso (e cego) da fam√≠lia Park. O contraste social √© exibido de forma afiada ‚Äî ora absurda, ora dolorosamente real ‚Äî sem cair em moralismo. A narrativa √© constru√≠da como um rel√≥gio su√≠√ßo: cada detalhe aparentemente trivial no come√ßo volta com for√ßa total para amarrar o cl√≠max surpreendente. A sutileza das piadas, aliada √† tens√£o crescente, transforma o filme numa montanha-russa emocional. E, por baixo de tudo, pulsa uma cr√≠tica social poderosa, que exp√µe as fissuras da desigualdade sem so√ßobrar em discursos √≥bvios. Com atua√ß√µes impec√°veis, dire√ß√£o cir√∫rgica e um roteiro que equilibra tons sem titubear, Parasita n√£o √© apenas entretenimento ‚Äî √© cinema feito para incomodar, divertir e deixar a gente pensando por muito tempo."
5.0,"Jul 19, 2025",I‚Äôm so glad they added that ending cause SPOILER ALERT I would not have been able to stand it if they ended the movie right at that garden scene
5.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Story is brilliantly woven, almost rhythmic like a sharp jazz drum solo. The film reveals that human flaws aren‚Äôt born from wealth or poverty, but are magnified by both. A blend of style, substance, and unsettling truth. Fun as hell from start to finish."
5.0,"Jul 18, 2025",Amazing and interesting all the way through.
4.5,"Jul 17, 2025",Great movie with great acting and makes you feel on edge the whole time and is surprisingly tragic
5.0,"Jul 17, 2025","Really great film, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","I believe Bong Joon Ho has become a master director. The first film he directed and that I saw was Parasite. I was blown away by his directing, the production, cinematography and acting. A S. Korean friend who also enjoys Parasite told me that the class differences, their style or ability to live is spot on. I have watched this film many times, and will watch it many more times in the future. It is in my personal top 10 foreign film list."
5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","I think about this film quite often,it is that good."
5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most perfectly-paced film of all-time. The story remains both compelling and elusive throughout. The plot is like a Russian nesting doll unfolding one twist after another. A truly perfect film.
4.5,"Jul 9, 2025","This movie was unexpectedly a masterpiece and also smartly funny and really well executed. I can‚Äôt really say anything cause this movie is just straight up a masterpiece and a must watch experience. I recommend you this art, it will blow your mind"
5.0,"Jul 8, 2025",I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Bong Joon Ho and Song Kang-Ho are AMAZING. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
4.5,"Jul 7, 2025",Never does a home play a leading role like the architectural masterpiece in Parasite. A home doesn't make a family; only people can. Mental illness doesn't discriminate between socio-economic classes. This isn't a Disney movie; especially ending.
0.5,"Jul 7, 2025","I am baffled why this movie was given so much attention. I couldn't even get past the first 35 minutes which were very slow going. I had absolutely zero emotional investment in the characters. When I look at audience reviews on this and other platforms, they seem over-the-top to the extent that it makes me wonder who was paid off and how. Nothing against the actors or the direction. It's just that there are so much better films."
4.5,"Jul 6, 2025",A very good film. I enjoyed every minute of it.

5.0,"Jun 29, 2025","One of my favorite movies and I don‚Äôt think recency bias will change that. It‚Äôs just one of those stories that is super original, contains a lot of metaphors, and keeps you wondering what will happen next. I went in with zero context and loved it. Also saw this in black and white which was cool I guess? Saw it again at home in color and it was even better."
5.0,"Jun 24, 2025",Good movie with great themes of classism. Definitely recommend. This is probably a career peak for the director
5.0,"Jun 21, 2025",Best Foreign movie I have ever seen Bong Joon Ho did it again
5.0,"Jun 20, 2025","A superb film that makes you grateful for what you do have. You find yourself feeling the emotions the characters experience throughout and thinking about your life and where you can relate within the film. It's well written, beautifully acted and extremly thought provoking. Cinematography is excellent as well."
5.0,"Jun 17, 2025","Ok, I was skeptical that a foreign film won Best Movie Oscar? This movie= Weird, but in a super cool way, almost like a David Lynch type film. Ultimately it's a Very Sad movie. I've seen other Korean films and though they usually are ok- they don't compare to American movies, this one, just based on it's originality and story, deserves the 5 stars- I don't give many that. The acting was good and not too hokey which Korean acting can be at times. The dialogue was good, some of it funny, and it's nicely directed and shot. Korea is Now, what America will be in 50 years- poverty and suffering so a few people can have everything they want. I'm gonna ruminate over this today and it's obviously going to stay in my collection. Great Film."

5.0,"Apr 30, 2025",Vaya obra maestra
4.5,"Apr 18, 2025","It's a bit overrated but 200K people seem to think this movie was the best movie of the 21st century. I've watched a lot of Korean revenge movies and this was probably not at the top. However for awards purposes I can see why it is ranked so high, Korean movies/shows were never really publicized until recently. Look at Squid Game, the reason it got global publicity was because of Netflix. Without Netflix it never would have gotten so much fame."
5.0,"Apr 18, 2025","All Time Classic. The editing and pacing are masterful. It reminds me of something that Hitchcock or even the Coen Brothers would make. It's extremely witty, has really good dark humor, and has tons of underlying commentary about poverty and a two class society and the different human expierence by each and how those worlds collide. It's an extremely intelligent thiller. The cinematography is first rate as well. The shots inside the house, deep focus, lighting, and direction are all just masterful. Everything else is really good. Never really seen something like this. Everyone should should give this a try once."
5.0,"Apr 15, 2025",Just an incredible movie which shows the different lives between different households. 1 poor and 1 rich. And Bong Joon Ho's directing is just incredible. Deserved every Oscar it won.
5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","a great movie in every way, an even better plane movie. But don't get scared away by it being in a different language it still is a perfect movie."
5.0,"Mar 26, 2025","Totally deserves the 4 Oscar awards it has won. Took me a while before I finally saw it, masterpiece! Watch it without reading any more info about it. Dont watch the trailer. I didnt and it was full of surprises for me."
5.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Downloaded this on the plane, thought it would suck... Might be one of the best movies I've watched."
4.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie ""Parasite."" The movie starts with the story of the main character's family. They live in a small basement room and aren't very healthy. They make a living by folding pizza boxes, which isn't a very well-paying job. Their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides, administered via wifi, and have to use them inshared spaces.Money problems also mean that they can't go to college.But then, the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person. His initial job as an English tutor, where he gained his teaching credentials, was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor, a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials, since his sister, who was also his art instructor, didn't have much money.Despite the lack of financial resources, the hero's creativity and methods won over the mother and child.It's heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor. Then, the father allowed him to become a driver, which he did with a clever plan. The film is full of moments that shed light on classism, like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the hero's father.There's also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the driver's body odor, drug trafficking, and underwear in the car that looks insulted. It all builds up to a point where the hero's father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death. Thoughts from this movie In our world, people who don't have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves. It's more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people. Even when we plan everything life doesn't always go as we'd hoped, as the hero's father learned the hard way. It's important to see challenges as chances to grow, like when the hero decided to become a tutor in a rich family to boost his family's finances and used his cooking skills to help out. But, as we all know, being greedy can sometimes bring about our own downfall. And that's exactly what happened to the hero's family. Their greed and the actions that followed led to a heartbreaking outcome. Overall of this movie This movie is a really great example of how different people's lives can be. It shows how the lower class and the upper class live, and how they feel about each other. It's a really interesting story that keeps you hooked for almost two hours. It's not a story with a lot of characters, but each character has their own interesting story and history. There are also clues throughout the movie that you have to look out for."
5.0,"Mar 22, 2025",Perfect from start to finish! It‚Äôs been my favorite for years.
3.5,"Mar 22, 2025","Good movies, but NOT Best Picture great. The social commentaries are spot on, pacing is good, ending is phenomenal, however still lacks that quality of memorable from a great movie like dialogue, memorable characters and overall feeling left once seen."
4.0,"Mar 22, 2025","Very good film. It describes the different life style of the 2 families ver well. My only negatives are there are a couple of scenes which weren‚Äôt needed as much, but overall, very good."
5.0,"Mar 21, 2025",Parasite review I love this movie it‚Äôs so funny and so messed up but kelp me entertained 5 star 10 out 10 star 100 out 100 star
5.0,"Mar 19, 2025","Engaging and conniving. The movie shoes that you need need explosions and CGI to tell a story that keeps you hooked. There's enough truth and caricaturizing in each character, so that everyone is important to the story. Don't spoil your first view by reading the plot or watching trailers. Just watch it and you'll be satisfied through and through."
5.0,"Mar 17, 2025","I thought this movie was brilliant. I'm not usually one for closed captions, but this one is well worth it!"
5.0,"Mar 11, 2025","There is one word and one word only that describes this film and its essence, and that word? ""Perfection"" is that word. I genuinely couldn't find ONE flaw in the film, from cinematography, to wide shots, acting, looks, side characters, this are very few movies that I can 100% say, is AMAZING and PERFECT, and this is one, you've done yourself a distaste by not watching this film"
0.5,"Mar 9, 2025",Didn't make it 30 minutes they first 29 were so painfull. This might be the worst movie ever made. Completely unwatchable.

5.0,"Mar 4, 2025","Magnificent ! A film that does what very few modern films seem to be able to do: make a highly entertaining film where the social messaging is apparent but it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the rest of the experience. Edgy, dark, funny and devastating."
5.0,"Mar 2, 2025",Perfect Film!!! Simply a Masterpiece!!!!
5.0,"Feb 26, 2025","Brilliant and razor-sharp social critique disguised as a thriller, balancing dark humor, tension, and drama with absolute mastery. Gripping story that exposes class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The film constantly shifts tones and keeps you on edge, making its message hit even harder. In a few words, it‚Äôs a cinematic masterpiece that sticks with you long after the credits roll."
2.5,"Feb 25, 2025",It was ok. A bit overhyped IMO. I didn't find any of the characters particularly relatable or likable. The Host was a much more entertaining film by Bong.
4.5,"Feb 25, 2025","Great acting, movie was super interesting. Thought the scheming and the characters felt realistic. Was interesting to see a different world dynamic struggle between the poor and the rich. Top 5 of my movies this year and I wish I had seen it sooner."
5.0,"Feb 20, 2025",I have seen this movie so many times and I never get bored of it. I absolutely recommend it!
5.0,"Feb 20, 2025","A wild story where you find yourself rooting for the villainous underdog. Parasite showcases the divide of classes in South Korea, which is familiar worldwide. Beautifully shot film with lots of heart, suspense, thrills and laughs."
4.5,"Feb 19, 2025",Bong Joon Ho is quite brilliant. It‚Äôs the class levels that are becoming the greatest divider of society. Wealth doesn‚Äôt insure dignity and class.

5.0,"Feb 11, 2025",love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025","I believe it is wonderful how the director is able to transform a seemingly normal beggining into a tenseful film that catches your attention fully. I also must applause the form the movie uses ""unharmful"" scenes to do so, in a way that, little by little, you understand the feeling of complete tiredoom from the poorer family. Absolutily unsettling and extraordinarius!"
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025","Third act was rough, just like every Osgood Perkins movie, but this one has something the others don't, which is incredibly gory deaths and impeccable comedic timing."
1.5,"Feb 10, 2025","I was advised to watch this without learning anything about it, that's what I did, no summary, no trailers. I only knew it won Best Picture so my expectations were high. Unfortunately I was let down big time. I expect to care about characters, I did not care about these. There was no one to root for, no hero, no attachment at all. It was like watching your neighbor's life that you couldn't care less about, drag on and on, until you realize in this case, that the twist and resolution was not meaningful either, as if the writer needed a conclusion and asked around for the most ridiculous ideas, then simply chose one and wrote it in. One review characterized this film as ""vapid"" and I fully agree. A good movie will at least move me emotionally in some way. This didn't do that either."

Since Parasite, I have been released into a new world of artistic cinema.

4.5,"Feb 5, 2025","A good example of fiction that inspires introspection, shows social commentary, but also doesn't skimp on dynamic entertainment. In a sea of movies that go through the social media fame and come out the other side as overrated, Parasite sustains its worth."

5.0,"Jan 29, 2025","In the year 2019 it has been a very busy year for films that actually have a seal of approval of films I've watched at that year. Some of which I haven't reviewed apart from three of them such as Little Women, The Gentlemen, Joker, The Irishman, Marriage Story, Uncut Gems, Toy Story 4, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and Avengers: Endgame, now we have a film which is a foreign film that many people including myself really, really love and we'll cherish it forever in years to come and that foreign film is got to be Parasite. Yes, Parasite, one of most anticipated films of all time and one of the memorable ones out there. Many people had difficulty watching it without knowing what they're saying but the subtitles can help them understand and since that this is another foreign film I reviewed I think I should be doing more if I had the chance. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money as they're all unemployed. Min-hyuk, a family friend, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, lie about his education to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich but na√Øve Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks. Moments later, Kim's family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks for their livelihood until something goes wrong. What makes this film so great is the its masterful blend of social commentary, suspenseful storytelling, complex characters, exceptional cinematography, and a tightly woven plot that explores the stark realities of class inequality, all delivered with a unique blend of dark humor and thrilling twists, making it a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience for viewers from diverse backgrounds. I'll be very honest here, it's not for me doing this review. There are millions of people who actually and giving it highest 5 star or 10/10 making it a much more worthy film even for a foreign film like there are many foreign films that really deserve more praise and never overlook them as a miss and this one is not because it's been loved by so many who love it even this film is on the list of films in Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic, even Letterboxd and I've been thinking: ""Is there any of me doing this review?"" and I know what's done has to be done just like I have to do a lot of movies I'll be doing next time, many which that are great and some of them are bad I have to rant to make you laugh. Like this movie here which is darkly comical unexpectedly. Even if you can understand the ending and everything about this film is immense. With many words to describe this movie, you know exactly what I mean so with that said, Parasite is one of the best films and best foreign films of 2019."
5.0,"Jan 28, 2025","There are just a few directors that have accomplished such a complex and unique combination of feelings, genres and twists, all of these in one movie. Bong Joon-ho did it, and he did it great. It's a movie about capitalism. About that intrinsic sense of belonging and owning, in societies so different, but so alike at the same time. The chemistry and behavior between the characters and their ""plans"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will ask yourself through the whole movie, who is the ""parasite"" of the story. A closer look at a family living in some unfortunate conditions and the contrast with the upper class, and how far will they go to have whatever (they think) they need to be happy."

3.5,"Jan 22, 2025","The ending is effective but I'm not sure it says much, other than that the disparities between rich and poor are senseless; that they breed mutual enmity out of resentment and indignation, or a sense of effete, supercillious perogative. It's layered, sure. It's also well executed; and in it's own way incisive. But honestly, I don't think it's ultimately saying anything a reasonably intelligent person, with enough life experience hasn't figured out for themselves already. Or maybe I've just been poor for too long? Are you stinking rich? Well, good for you! Watch Parasite. Or don't, no one will care, least of all you, either way. Are you poor? Well, you probably won't be overly impressed. Are you middle-class? Well, no one cares for your opinions of this film, excepting other middle class folk of course. So have at it!"
4.0,"Jan 18, 2025",Parasite isn't the grand treatise on class disparity that people have made it out to be. But it's a great thriller that's just ridiculous enough to keep from being too depressing.
5.0,"Jan 16, 2025","An amazing dark comedy thriller that seamlessly blends clever satire and dreadful tension about class divide and how it forces otherwise good people into a fight for survival by any means necessary. Despite the subtitles, I was so engrossed by the almost-hypnotic visual storytelling, the easily relatable identifiable performances, and the page-turner narrative that constantly keeps you on your toes with not knowing where the story's going yet continuously building upon itself with amazingly brisk pacing despite its 2+ hour runtime. I love how there's so many layers to the themes and even who's the real titular ""parasite"" given all the individual actions vs the root systematic cause of their actions. It's also just genuinely hilarious despite the dark turn it takes. But even that dark turn feels naturally woven into the narrative without feeling like cheap scares for shock value. It's an amazing cinematic experience and easily one of my favorite movies of 2019."

5.0,"Nov 3, 2024","I just finished watching the Film. The first thing I need to say, shouldn't be about the film itself but rather about the feelings within me right after it. I am sure many of you might know the painful feeling of emptiness, one might experience if ones favorite Series, with characters and a Story, you had the chance to bond to over an extensive amount of time and many episodes and seasons, comes to an end. You just feel without a clear goal. It feels like a good friend has died (ok maybe not that bad) and you need to learn what to do with yourself again after having got used to spending all your time with him/her. This was the first movie, that made me feel this way. You might say, that feeling like this might sound like a terrible thing, and in some way it is. But if I personally deeply think about it I would object. This feeling is a wonderful testiment of how great a movie was able to touch the viewers emotion and soul. In a weird philosophical way it is proof of the true humanity of everybody that feels it. I dont think this movies brilliance can be boiled down or be dissected in individual parts like cinematography, characters or story. It is the great sum of all those parts that creates the true brilliance, being the feelings it awakens in its viewers. It perfectly mirrors an each and every humans being in a way. This is why you might feel a rush of those described negative emotions. But if you think about it and feel really deep within yourself...It also awakens the feeling of being understood and a part of a greater, loneliness-expelling community of beings that are in some or another way connected by interest or emotion and therefore possess the ability to archieve wonderful and amazing feats... ...such as creating this movie"

3.0,"Sep 10, 2024","I don‚Äôt get the exaggerated hype. Sure, this is one unpredictable plot with great cinematography and performances, sprinkled with an entrancing soundtrack. That makes it far from perfect nonetheless. The first part is tedious and seems elongated, while the second part is not that different, except for a slightly-rushed infamous scene. As a whole, Parasite is peculiar but also somewhat pretentious, and this has nothing to do with the portrayal of a snobbish bunch, but rather with the way through which this snobby-needy juxtaposition is dealt with. In a world of extremes where the ratings for this movie are either 5 stars or just half a star, I choose to take the rocky path, and declare the following: this isn‚Äôt a movie one would find oneself itching to watch again any time soon, but it also isn‚Äôt one short of standing beside the classics."

Sure there's a little suspense with the basement, but that's about it. I truly did not see the hype on this movie, as a movie buff as well. I watched it in all subtitles, but I don't think that's what killed the experience for me. The plot felt, nonsensical, or rather, inconsequential. The script didn't have any standouts. The character relationships or other character tropes weren't anything special. The only interesting point was seeing how rich people, aren't really aware of their riches, or how other people might look at them / strive to be like them. Is that truly indicative of a bigger scale or just a piece of these characters, who knows."

4.5,"Apr 16, 2024","""Parasite"" stands as a cinematic tour de force, a searing indictment of the socioeconomic disparities entrenched within Korean society. Director Bong Joon-ho masterfully crafts a narrative that pulsates with tension, expertly weaving together themes of class struggle and human desperation. The film's chaotic energy is palpable from start to finish, ensnaring viewers in its gripping tale of deceit and survival. At its core, ""Parasite"" presents a scathing critique of the cavernous divide between the haves and the have-nots, as the destitute Kim family infiltrates the affluent Park household through a web of deception. Each twist and turn in the plot serves to intensify the film's relentless momentum, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats as they grapple with the moral ambiguities laid bare before them. What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to provoke introspection long after the credits have rolled. The film's rich tapestry of characters and layered narrative demand multiple viewings, each unveiling new depths to explore and dissect. Bong Joon-ho's directorial prowess shines brightly, infusing every frame with a sense of urgency and unease that lingers in the mind. In the end, ""Parasite"" transcends the confines of its genre, emerging as a profound meditation on the human condition and the corrosive effects of inequality. It is a cinematic experience that demands to be rewatched, its impact only deepening with each subsequent viewing. In a landscape inundated with mediocrity, ""Parasite"" stands as a beacon of artistic excellence‚Äîa film that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on cinema for years to come."

Plenty of other films have expressed the same social criticisms, but it's the exploration of human desperation with extreme authenticity and realism that is so haunting. It's disturbing, yet brilliant, and is what really makes <i>Parasite</i> standout, it exposes the inequalities between social classes, and how it brings out the worst in everyone."

4.5,"Mar 9, 2024","It begins with a family of four from the lower class in Korean society: a father, mother, eldest son, and younger sister. Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film. It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway. While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point. Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality. Moving on to the movie's overall impact, I enjoyed with many emotions and perspectives, but the things that make this movie win so many awards and praise are the analysis and solving of each case and the clear satire of life. If anyone likes this kind of movie, it's certainly one worth watching."

3.5,"Dec 20, 2023","This film is absolutely thrilling, engaging, and contains elements that will grip you throughout its entirety. However, I think there are far better movies from South Korea that I myself have seen recently such as ""A moment to remember,"" & ""Past lives."" They might not be of the same genre, but the previously stated films, mainly ""A moment to remember,"" deserves to be equally acclaimed of not more. Despite lacking thrilling aspects, which most of the time is what forces us to be glued on our sofa expecting every upcoming moments, these movies rely on romance, interesting stories, and subtly reveal concepts that we rarely stumble upon on most movies and series being released these days. The actors are impeccably competent, the excellency of the cinematography is unimaginable, and the sets display visually appealing areas of the Asian continent. This is an area that I think ""Parasite"" must have capitalized on. Gladly, they saved the whole thing with twists and turns, mainly one that makes the 2h12 worth your time."
4.5,"Dec 8, 2023","Saw this in the theater when it came out and then saw it again two days ago. Excellent portrait of rich and poor and, as always with Korean cinema, the innate flaws of humanity and pitfalls of an infinitely imperfect universe. Sometimes the morally superior position is unoccupied because, given the tools the characters have been assigned in life, the morally superior position is exceedingly difficult to compute and/or attain."
3.5,"Dec 6, 2023","The movie Parasite directed by Bong Joon-ho was released on October 11, 2019. This movie started Lee Sun-kyun, Park So-dam, and Choi Woo-Shink. The movie starts off with a poor family living in a home in Seoul. They manage to work for a rich family and soon get to enjoy the rich life status once their bosses leave. The movie takes a turn and involves science that some may consider violent. As the poor family is at the rich families home, the poor families home gets flooded. Kim Ki-woo, the son of the poor family is trying to get his family out of their poorness and just wants to be apreciated by them so he tries everything he can to get them a wealthier life. SPOILER: During the flood he reaches for the rock which his family thought was worthless while Kim Ki-woo knew it had value. He saves the rock and gets out the home. Overall This movie is entertaining but may be confusing fro some."
5.0,"Dec 3, 2023","""It keeps clinging to me"" Parasite will be remembered for generations. Every frame is a painting and, despite its harrowing depiction of the damages of classism, a shared struggle emerges which is, simply put, human. Anyway, fun stuff!"
4.5,"Nov 22, 2023","Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come. The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties. (ESHS Film Club- Yumna Khan, Jonah Gardiner, Stevon, Sonia C)"

I don't like such films where people lye and the whole film is circulated about the false which will come truth in the end. But I really like that this film leaded me to understand the truth that I can't reach. It's the inability to find a job. As a part of a western world I have founded myself in the beginning of the film as ""hey you why can't you just find any job to survive?"" Then I came to understanding that this is another world in South Korea. Also I don't like open endings so I'm writing it because of it ü§†"

4.5,"Aug 30, 2023","Parasite is definitely a ""must see"" film in 2019, and is often regarded as Bong Joon-ho's most influential masterpiece of a black-comedy, who also directed the acclaimed films such as Snowpiercer, Okja, Memories of Murder, and The Host, and the first Korean film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. This plot centers about the unemployed destitute Kim clan who pretend to be highly-qualified individuals by infiltrating the wealthy Park family.."

The build up is a ride that keeps getting higher and higher until it eventually starts to drop into chilling thrills and it delivers more than expected. Well crafted climaxes. It feels pretty insane and dramatic, but it still knows how to be humourous. The cinematography and music is fantastic and highlights the storytelling very well, while the cast is brilliant and convincing on their part during the whole act. The editing is very clever and engaging. The use and timing of the slow motion dramatizes scenes just perfect. The script is flawless. The sets compliment the narrative and create a great contrasts between the two families. The flooding scene looked pretty good, including the explosive toilet. There's seemingly no scene that feels out of place. Nothing in this movie went to waste. A masterpiece."

3.5,"Jun 17, 2023","This is s very good movie. What makes it so is it presents very complex relationships in a simplified, limited sets environment. There is an intimacy to the proceedings, and this augments the comedic aspect as well. The acting is efficient and effective. The one drawback is the two dimensional characters; presented as absolute versions of rich and poor. In other words, you're either on this side or that side. That is not to say that there are not people that act and think this way. It all seems very convenient and you can predict character reactions. There is no warmth or sympathy between the families. No personal connections, with everyone being disposable and blind to one another. They pursue their own self interests without ethics or morality. Either a hustler or very gullible. However, as a black comedy this can work and it does so throughout the movie. It is a movie that must be thought about, considering each layer like Matryoshka Dolls. Class interactions causing intra-class dichotomies and violence. A very harsh movie on its own characters. I have watched it more than once. I pick up something new or a new idea about the film with each viewing. Exactly the effect a thinking movie should have on its audience."

5.0,"Jun 7, 2023",Best Korean movie of all time.
5.0,"Jun 7, 2023","The first half of the film is darkly humorous, with a family living in a basement lying and framing the driver and housekeeper in an effort to work for the rich. When I saw the first half, I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Until they see rich people go camping, but the Jin family actually live in the mansion, eat and drink, and completely consider themselves rich. It makes me uncomfortable to see this because it is ""greed"". They want to make money. That's normal. But to enjoy a life of utter hypocrisy is ""greed"". Seeing the heavy rain, I thought the host family would come back. The good part of the movie is the return of the old butler. The turning point of the film is the scene leading to the basement. From this moment on, this is no longer a comedy. It became a conspiracy, a bigger lie, a fight for life. I thought that the Jin family has parasitic in the rich family, did not think that the old housekeeper and her husband is a bigger parasite. After watching this movie, I always wonder what I would have done if I was living in a basement, working for a rich man. I will definitely work hard to make money, change a better house, and then through this job to find a better job for myself. That should be most people's plan. The Jin family, although very smart, also very good at work. But they are lazy, do not make progress, do not have a plan, and do not seek to change the status quo. So they would rather be parasites and feel inferior than change the status quo. The lesson of this film is that if you are not satisfied with your life, you must find a way to improve the quality of your life, because you can!"
3.0,"May 31, 2023","It was entertaining but not mind-blowingly good as many western critics indicated. Part of the confusion is caused by western critics who seem to be evaluating the plot's shock value based on a European/western 3-act structure instead of the 4-act Asian structure. This movie plot follows the latter and is consistent with the timing and expected twists and turns of that structure. After accounting for the 4-act structure, this plot is not as shocking or surprising as western critics seem to think. Instead, it takes the expected twists & turns in the expected order, which reduces its shock value. Still, it's an entertaining way to pass a few hours."

3.5,"Mar 31, 2023","Overrated is the operative word. This is a year that gave us Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917, JoJo Rabbit, all of which I believe were far stronger accomplishments. Regardless of that, this is a good film, at times very good, but there's nothing that merits the hoopla other than a foreign film being the the esoteric darling of that year's Hollywood cultural mentality about cultural mentalities. Parasite isn't worth vaccinating against, but its overactive accolades were a bit pestilential."

Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities.

Surely this couldn't get any worse but as the light went dim and the projector starting whirling I stared in pure baffling awe as the movie wasn't even in English no seriously who would have left such a grave technical error in the final product. I had to squint and read the tiny text at the bottom surely damped my mood. This movie was only made to hate on rich people which is insensitive because they are only using the fruits of their labor to live their everyday lives.

5.0,"Oct 11, 2022","Director Bong Joon Ho has always been preoccupied with socioeconomic disparity, but he takes it to an entirely different level with Parasite. When the impoverished Kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy Park family, life for both families spirals out of control, resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror. Parasite is a film truly unlike any other, an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses. Bong Joon Ho, a master of visuals, frames and blocks every shot meticulously. Humor is perfectly balanced with suspense, all while remaining faithful to his theme. Parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not the best."

4.5,"Sep 6, 2022",a very good but not absolutely incredible movie. uses symbolism the most very well. very good storytelling through visuals
2.5,"Sep 5, 2022","Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics. Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact. The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible. It will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons. Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre. Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."
4.5,"Sep 2, 2022","shocking to see so many korean actors in a korean film of course, where's your diversity ? The film was very good with interesting social commentary, but I did find it a little absurd in places and the ending wasn't for me"
4.5,"Sep 1, 2022","This is a tense and somewhat unsettling film, which is thrilling and claustrophobic at times. Its certainly a multi-layered plot that builds up slowly. I wouldn't want to say anymore so as not to provide any potential spoilers. Its not clear from the start what's going to happen and it's a film that's likely enjoyed more if you don't have too many pre-conceptions. Its certainly quite a memorable film. I wouldn't say it's the most thought provoking film I've ever seen by any means but it is pretty thoughtful, in terms of the general societal themes covered. I would certainly recommend it if your keen on world cinema and like to watch films that keep you guessing."
5.0,"Aug 28, 2022","Der Film ist eine Mischung von Schauspiel, Thriller, Gleichnis, Posse, Karikatur und Kom√∂die. Und spielt das soziale Ungleichgewicht in S√ºd-Korea und sogleich der Welt an.

4.5,"Aug 24, 2022",Brilliant satire-thriller with great characters and story. However that underwhelming climax wasn't delivered as good and slick as the rest of the film.
2.5,"Aug 20, 2022","Parasite isn't as good as what people say it is. Spoilers ahead. Bong Joon-ho's career has potential, but that's about it. The movie had a good enough plot to draw me in, but it became predictable after a while. As soon as I realized its predictability, it became quite boring, and don't even get me started with its ""twist."" There was always something shady about the maid, mostly because we knew a bit about everyone else besides her, so I knew she wasn't just a maid. The basement is the movie's biggest plot hole. I think that's because, if a wealthy South Korean bought a house, wouldn't they have one as their first concern? During the film's twist, Mun-Kwang mentions exactly what I said, even mentioning the creditors, but then he goes on to say: ""Maybe Mr. Namgoong felt embarrassed about building such a room. He didn't mention it to the Parks when he sold the house."" The conclusion here strikes me as lazy. A major concern people have with this film is the message it conveys. It conveys that rich people have a perfect life, a life of innocence and gullibility. Rich people aren't as innocent as they appear from what I have seen from the majority of rich people. Their gullibility is a result of believing everything the Kim Family tells them. Yes, it's said they will take anyone who gets recommended by a friend after talking to them, interviewing them, perhaps asking for some papers, and then believing them. People who are rich often feel they don't have all the money in the world, and they need more money to live a happy life. It seems absurd to me to think that way. There is always a tendency for someone to exaggerate when recommending someone to another person. It would be impossible to truly know this person, even in the interview, if they were not exaggerating when they were being interviewed, and they may have some past job offers and great school degrees, but how would you trust someone being recommended to you? It's truly disgusting how they convey that poor people will do whatever it takes to survive, even drive themselves to murder, which isn't the solution to their problem. Regardless of whether it's seen through the lens of a foreign country's economics, it shouldn't be portrayed at all. The ending really rubs me in the wrong way with just a straight up killing spree. The motives of all the characters' are all over the place, but this is by far the worst ending coming behind Spiral, just for its shock value."

5.0,"Aug 14, 2022","A haunting pitch black comedy that thoroughly skewers the dog eat dog world of capitalism. It leaves you feeling lost in the fog of who the real parasite is: the poor who must violently contend against each other and fight dirty for a chance to suckle off the teat of the rich, or the rich who are infantilized by their own wealth into a selfish helplessness on which they survive off the labors of those they keep in destitution. The twists kept me on the edge of my seat, while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds. All of this brings you to an ending so bleak, it highlights the faults in a system where the only way to live is without direction, as any plan is folly in the face of where you are born under capitalism."
1.5,"Aug 14, 2022","Parasite is like a Boeing 777 taking off vertically, soaring high, losing velocity, and falling to earth in a raging fireball. In other words, I've seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie, or so let down by the last 2. What makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp, fairy-tale structure of the plot, offering glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe, filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling. The Kim family's takeover of a palatial hillside home, or at least the downstairs bit, is a joy to behold. It follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation, as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood. No problem: Mrs. Kim, with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an ""art therapist,"" is right on hand to fill the spot. Despite the folktale vibe, there's plenty of nuance too. We are not invited to simply pity the destitute Kims or to despise the complacent Parks. Somewhere midway through, Mr. Kim shares his life's store of wisdom with his son: planning things out is a waste of time, and whatever happens, happens. What can you do? With such a patriarch, it's not hard to see how the Kims have made themselves desperately poor. Equally reprehensible is the Kims' outlook toward the Parks, whom they dehumanize as gullible marks. Meanwhile, the Parks are presented as clean, organized, and essentially decent. Mrs. Park, despite her emotional imbalance, is particularly winsome, and you flinch when the Kims call her an idiot behind her back. Unfortunately, all of this nuance is lost by the end. Other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie, but I would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks. In seeing Mr. Kim, hired as a chauffeur, forced to don an Indian headdress for a birthday party, we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world. In seeing his neighborhood flooded with sewage after heavy rains, we are to understand that the very structure of the world keeps him wallowing in filth. And when, while Mrs. Park is driven on a lengthy shopping tour, we see her feet stretched toward the front seat alongside Mr. Kim's face, we are to gather that he is at the family's mercy. This kind of ham-fistedness reveals the severe limits of socialist comprehension; it cannot really get at the human condition. When the story ends in a bloodbath, you know it's gone off the rails in a bad way. It's not merely the loss of structure or the conflation of genres that bothers me; it's the draining of expansiveness and humanity."

The story also moves at a very efficient pace, it's fast but every scene adds to the story, and it slows down when it needs to. Parasite is truly gripping, partially due to its structure, and it uses both humor, and tension expertly. The films message is clearly conveyed, not only through the characters and their actions, but also very much through the cinematography. There are some nice dichotomies that separate rich and poor ‚Äì light and dark, clean and dirty, and high and low."

5.0,"Apr 6, 2022","Parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece. Having won many awards at the 92nd Academy Awards like Best International Feature Film, this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting, cinematography, and its relatability. Based in Korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the Kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned. Parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall, creating such believable families. The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting. Its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a must-watch alongside its technical aspects. It's an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally. All these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience, which makes it stand above the rest."

Works, makes sense - you root for the Kim's - until the bizarre events of toward the end. Those choices seem somewhat contrived, and out of character for characters that have repeatedly demonstrated themselves as bright, and capable of 'passing for hardworking smarter-than-everyone-else competent people', for extended periods of time to get and keep their target jobs. Truthfully though, this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy, intoxicated underachievers, that can't consistently even fold boxes with any consistency, who suddenly and miraculously pull 'smart choices', and super-spy-level skills and talents out of seeming 'nowhere'. I think it misses somewhat in the 'capitalism is the problem' angle, widely pitched, as the Kims are clearly very capable and motivated, and can achieve amazing things, when they apply themselves, but seem to have arrived at their semi-basement apartment - and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes - through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia. Recommended, just not as satisfying as I'd hoped."

Perhaps some of the images slightly symbolical, ie. poor people living in the basement below the rich and the family's dad killing a bug (ie.

I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene.

They both reflect the harsh reality of social hierarchy, loan sharks, financial instability, and the filthy rich. Combinations which, as we see in both Parasite and Squid Game, lead to utter chaos."

4.0,"Sep 18, 2021","Fantastic. Definitely a different feel from most movies I've seen. Worth the watch and the insight into the social commentary. I had a very different perception of this movie when I saw its poster. It definitely turns dark very quickly at the end, but then has a nice yet eerie resolution in the end. Would recommend if you enjoy film and something different."
5.0,"Sep 18, 2021","Parasite movie is outstanding. It has many levels, great detail and a fresh, even harsh look at the rich-poor divide in the world today. Some scenes evoke Tarantino's signature, but it is made in the best tradition of Japanese movie art. You cannot stop to think about this film even next day. Every body must see it and think about our wrong world where one part lives in prosperity and the other part struggles restlessly to survive."
3.0,"Sep 14, 2021","Since it received the 2020 Best Picture Academy award, I felt compelled to watch the film despite the fact that it was sub-titled with no English overdub or Audio Description. Too bad I hadn't taken more than a couple of semesters of French in high school, since they did have a French overdub track. ;-) It was a decent film. I'm not sure it was worthy of best picture, though."

I really enjoyed the peek into Korean culture, or at least what I assume to be Korean culture. It's fresh and different. It blends seriousness and comedy very well, and it's definitely up there for movies I've seen. I'm not entirely sure about the message itself. I rarely find that movies can deliver a stellar message, like a book can, as they don't seem to have enough time. But it's very entertaining and worth re-watching, which I wouldn't say about too many movies."
5.0,"Sep 11, 2021","This was quite a film, the outturning events are rather very unexpected yet somehow plausible, you can't possibly predict the ending from its beginning. the characters actions were messed up and led to their deteriorating eventually, but we tend to not focus on the circumstances that led to those actions, It's perhaps the inevitable damage emerging out of endless desperation."

5.0,"Aug 28, 2021","What a rollercoaster. The first thing that stood out was the cinematography and environments in this film which are gorgeous. The structure of the story is subtle and peels away layers as its interesting characters become more involved in the plot. The music elegantly heightens the tone of this film too. The film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in Korean culture. People leeching off of others is apparent. The social commentary here is blatant. Karma is a thing. But what I felt resonated most was the importance of family. The theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes. Bong Joon Ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today, but in a way that will not become dated. Parasite is a weave of dark tones, intrigue, mystery, and humour, and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today."

5.0,"Jul 19, 2021","Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script. The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful. Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10"
5.0,"Jul 11, 2021","'Parasite' is an incredible, thrilling, suspenseful, twisty, sophisticated film. Not one moment on screen is wasted when this exciting plot is unfolding. It is very difficult to praise this film without revealing any spoilers, but if you are even curious about watching this, watch it.

5.0,"Jul 6, 2021","Wow, this family is so poor that they don't even live on ground level, they live below the street, below society. I like the mother, she's sassy and doesn't give a damn to speak her mind. Wow, that place is like a fortress. It's so beautiful, pristine like a palace. It looks like it doesn't even belong in the city. Something's kind of fishy with this huge house and it's inhabitants and I'm very curios as to what happens. I've noticed from watching several Korean movies, that they have a really good sense of humor. Almost very random and unexpected when it happens. The madame is quite attractive, she's cute. She's also very lively and has a great sense of humor. Hmm, that wall illuminating all the dishes and kitchen ware seems important, very interesting. These poor kids are really street smart, what they lack in wealth, they may up for with wits and grit. Fake it till you make it I guess is their motto. Wow, I don't know what to think about this poor family. Their motives and their plan is quite diabolical. They've basically gotten rid of all the help the rich family had. They even got rid of the housekeeper who seemed like a nice older lady. They seem kind of scum baggy to me, they're scummy people. I'm beginning to think that this poor family isn't a family at all and maybe they like work for the same company or person or something? Dude wtf is going on? Lol! There's this underground room where the old housekeeper's husband is living down there? Dude this is so fucking weird. I can't believe they got away with that escape. Holy shit, that was butt clenching. It's at this moment that the movie shifts into a completely different direction and even changes in mood and genre becoming more of a thriller/horror. It seems like the main theme is this movie is lies and deception. What you see, isn't really what you get and you can't really trust just about anyone, even if they're recommended by a reliable source. It's very odd to watch unfold, but this poor family has basically integrated themselves into the lives of this rich family. I guess they're all parasites feeding off this rich family. I don't know why but now I feel like the rich family is going to do something unexpected. I feel like there's going to be some kind of fucked up twist that's going to happen. They were the stink bugs all along, the lower class, the poor. There was a lot of twisted moments from both families. Beautifully filmed. The cinematography and compositions are impeccable. A feat of technical perfection. Brilliantly and cleverly written. Masterfully executed and filled with plenty of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. My only problem with the movie is that it's hard to relate to any of the characters since they're all essentially parasites and they all have really scummy characteristics to them, both the poor and the rich families. I guess I could relate the most to the rich families son and daughter. Watching this movie movie was something very exciting and thrilling, I didn't know what to expect next. I would definitely watch this movie again."

It's a little bloody and disturbing, but it's also extremely satisfying. It's like watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood all over again, but much better.

5.0,"Apr 24, 2021","This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek's house. He lives on an ""intermediate floor"", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror. Director Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man's house, the poor's middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park's wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict. The first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park's innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens. Fortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways. Finally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss's hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a ""subway smell"") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, ""gourmet balconies"", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live. When the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: ""What would Min do in this situation?"", he asks. Her sister replies: ""Min would never be in this situation"". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war."

4.5,"Apr 20, 2021","Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched. Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house. Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding The only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal. Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come."

5.0,"Apr 18, 2021",Very painful after watching
4.0,"Apr 17, 2021","The movie is very important by reporting the social inequality, seen in the big differences between the houses in which the two families live, the employments of the both, how life is easilier to the rich family e all the difficulties that the poor family has to deal with. Another thing very well expressed in the movie are the selfishness of the dominant class, when after the man hided in the basement be killed, all the boss have to say is about the ""poor smell"" of the man that had just lost his life. Also, the movie handles very well that belonging to the dominant class brings some symbols, as the rich family daugher's access to foreign language classes, and the youngest son's access to art classes. And, in addition, rely on the services of more than one domestic employee. My only reservation about the movie is that it's history would be better exploited if it proposed a collective response to the social inequality, and not as response to it the social ascension of few people, which is desired by the poor family soon. That way, he would save his father that stayed at the rich house's basement. Finally, the actor's performances and the script are very well directed, knowing when to give the drama tone or even the comedy tone, when it was necessary."
