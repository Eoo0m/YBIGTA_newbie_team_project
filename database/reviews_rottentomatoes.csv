5.0,"Jul 19, 2025",I’m so glad they added that ending cause SPOILER ALERT I would not have been able to stand it if they ended the movie right at that garden scene
5.0,"Jul 18, 2025","Story is brilliantly woven, almost rhythmic like a sharp jazz drum solo. The film reveals that human flaws aren’t born from wealth or poverty, but are magnified by both. A blend of style, substance, and unsettling truth. Fun as hell from start to finish."
5.0,"Jul 18, 2025",Amazing and interesting all the way through.
4.5,"Jul 17, 2025",Great movie with great acting and makes you feel on edge the whole time and is surprisingly tragic
5.0,"Jul 17, 2025","Really great film, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","I believe Bong Joon Ho has become a master director. The first film he directed and that I saw was Parasite. I was blown away by his directing, the production, cinematography and acting. A S. Korean friend who also enjoys Parasite told me that the class differences, their style or ability to live is spot on. I have watched this film many times, and will watch it many more times in the future. It is in my personal top 10 foreign film list."
5.0,"Jul 10, 2025","I think about this film quite often,it is that good."
5.0,"Jul 9, 2025",A cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most perfectly-paced film of all-time. The story remains both compelling and elusive throughout. The plot is like a Russian nesting doll unfolding one twist after another. A truly perfect film.
4.5,"Jul 9, 2025","This movie was unexpectedly a masterpiece and also smartly funny and really well executed. I can’t really say anything cause this movie is just straight up a masterpiece and a must watch experience. I recommend you this art, it will blow your mind"
5.0,"Jul 8, 2025",I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Bong Joon Ho and Song Kang-Ho are AMAZING. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
4.5,"Jul 7, 2025",Never does a home play a leading role like the architectural masterpiece in Parasite. A home doesn't make a family; only people can. Mental illness doesn't discriminate between socio-economic classes. This isn't a Disney movie; especially ending.
0.5,"Jul 7, 2025","I am baffled why this movie was given so much attention. I couldn't even get past the first 35 minutes which were very slow going. I had absolutely zero emotional investment in the characters. When I look at audience reviews on this and other platforms, they seem over-the-top to the extent that it makes me wonder who was paid off and how. Nothing against the actors or the direction. It's just that there are so much better films."
4.5,"Jul 6, 2025",A very good film. I enjoyed every minute of it.
0.5,"Jul 5, 2025","This movie has such high ratings, but I tried streaming it twice and abandoned it twice."
5.0,"Jul 4, 2025",Great masterpiece 👌
5.0,"Jul 1, 2025",Great film. The last 25 minutes is astounding! Simply a masterpiece!
4.5,"Jul 1, 2025","The story builds so well that when the chaos finally hits, it feels earned and unforgettable."
5.0,"Jun 30, 2025",One of the best movies ever produced.
5.0,"Jun 29, 2025","One of my favorite movies and I don’t think recency bias will change that. It’s just one of those stories that is super original, contains a lot of metaphors, and keeps you wondering what will happen next. I went in with zero context and loved it. Also saw this in black and white which was cool I guess? Saw it again at home in color and it was even better."
5.0,"Jun 24, 2025",Good movie with great themes of classism. Definitely recommend. This is probably a career peak for the director
5.0,"Jun 21, 2025",Best Foreign movie I have ever seen Bong Joon Ho did it again
5.0,"Jun 20, 2025","A superb film that makes you grateful for what you do have. You find yourself feeling the emotions the characters experience throughout and thinking about your life and where you can relate within the film. It's well written, beautifully acted and extremly thought provoking. Cinematography is excellent as well."
5.0,"Jun 17, 2025","Ok, I was skeptical that a foreign film won Best Movie Oscar? This movie= Weird, but in a super cool way, almost like a David Lynch type film. Ultimately it's a Very Sad movie. I've seen other Korean films and though they usually are ok- they don't compare to American movies, this one, just based on it's originality and story, deserves the 5 stars- I don't give many that. The acting was good and not too hokey which Korean acting can be at times. The dialogue was good, some of it funny, and it's nicely directed and shot. Korea is Now, what America will be in 50 years- poverty and suffering so a few people can have everything they want. I'm gonna ruminate over this today and it's obviously going to stay in my collection. Great Film."
5.0,"Jun 4, 2025",Wish I could give it ten stars!
4.5,"Jun 4, 2025",This movie proves that Bong Joon Ho is a GENIUS!
5.0,"Jun 3, 2025",I ain’t got much to say that hasn’t been said already.
5.0,"Jun 3, 2025",Watched it with my brother and we can't get over how good and gruesome it is in it's nature. A MUST WATCH.
5.0,"May 29, 2025",This is what great Cinema looks like Phenomenal acting and direction and brilliant in all the technical aspects. But the storyline and underlying message make it a masterpiece
5.0,"May 22, 2025",Black humor that comes with a dreary tension
0.5,"May 17, 2025",Do yourself a favour and scroll past this movie. Total rubbish!

Success in 2 hours and 12 minutes!!!!!!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $53,700,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"May 9, 2025","Loved that movie, I hadn't seen the trailer before and it was a complete surprise! Climax, direction, writing, everything is incredible!"

5.0,"May 3, 2025","I watched this movie a few times now and keep on being amazed by the story line, production and the downfall of being greedy"
5.0,"May 2, 2025",A beautiful film that brings you on a fun journey then leaves you stunned and introspective. My #1
5.0,"Apr 30, 2025",Vaya obra maestra
4.5,"Apr 18, 2025","It's a bit overrated but 200K people seem to think this movie was the best movie of the 21st century. I've watched a lot of Korean revenge movies and this was probably not at the top. However for awards purposes I can see why it is ranked so high, Korean movies/shows were never really publicized until recently. Look at Squid Game, the reason it got global publicity was because of Netflix. Without Netflix it never would have gotten so much fame."
5.0,"Apr 18, 2025","All Time Classic. The editing and pacing are masterful. It reminds me of something that Hitchcock or even the Coen Brothers would make. It's extremely witty, has really good dark humor, and has tons of underlying commentary about poverty and a two class society and the different human expierence by each and how those worlds collide. It's an extremely intelligent thiller. The cinematography is first rate as well. The shots inside the house, deep focus, lighting, and direction are all just masterful. Everything else is really good. Never really seen something like this. Everyone should should give this a try once."
5.0,"Apr 15, 2025",Just an incredible movie which shows the different lives between different households. 1 poor and 1 rich. And Bong Joon Ho's directing is just incredible. Deserved every Oscar it won.
5.0,"Apr 8, 2025","a great movie in every way, an even better plane movie. But don't get scared away by it being in a different language it still is a perfect movie."
5.0,"Mar 26, 2025","Totally deserves the 4 Oscar awards it has won. Took me a while before I finally saw it, masterpiece! Watch it without reading any more info about it. Dont watch the trailer. I didnt and it was full of surprises for me."
5.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Downloaded this on the plane, thought it would suck... Might be one of the best movies I've watched."
4.0,"Mar 24, 2025","Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie ""Parasite."" The movie starts with the story of the main character's family. They live in a small basement room and aren't very healthy. They make a living by folding pizza boxes, which isn't a very well-paying job. Their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides, administered via wifi, and have to use them inshared spaces.Money problems also mean that they can't go to college.But then, the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person. His initial job as an English tutor, where he gained his teaching credentials, was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor, a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials, since his sister, who was also his art instructor, didn't have much money.Despite the lack of financial resources, the hero's creativity and methods won over the mother and child.It's heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor. Then, the father allowed him to become a driver, which he did with a clever plan. The film is full of moments that shed light on classism, like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the hero's father.There's also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the driver's body odor, drug trafficking, and underwear in the car that looks insulted. It all builds up to a point where the hero's father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death. Thoughts from this movie In our world, people who don't have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves. It's more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people. Even when we plan everything life doesn't always go as we'd hoped, as the hero's father learned the hard way. It's important to see challenges as chances to grow, like when the hero decided to become a tutor in a rich family to boost his family's finances and used his cooking skills to help out. But, as we all know, being greedy can sometimes bring about our own downfall. And that's exactly what happened to the hero's family. Their greed and the actions that followed led to a heartbreaking outcome. Overall of this movie This movie is a really great example of how different people's lives can be. It shows how the lower class and the upper class live, and how they feel about each other. It's a really interesting story that keeps you hooked for almost two hours. It's not a story with a lot of characters, but each character has their own interesting story and history. There are also clues throughout the movie that you have to look out for."
5.0,"Mar 22, 2025",Perfect from start to finish! It’s been my favorite for years.
3.5,"Mar 22, 2025","Good movies, but NOT Best Picture great. The social commentaries are spot on, pacing is good, ending is phenomenal, however still lacks that quality of memorable from a great movie like dialogue, memorable characters and overall feeling left once seen."
4.0,"Mar 22, 2025","Very good film. It describes the different life style of the 2 families ver well. My only negatives are there are a couple of scenes which weren’t needed as much, but overall, very good."
5.0,"Mar 21, 2025",Parasite review I love this movie it’s so funny and so messed up but kelp me entertained 5 star 10 out 10 star 100 out 100 star
5.0,"Mar 19, 2025","Engaging and conniving. The movie shoes that you need need explosions and CGI to tell a story that keeps you hooked. There's enough truth and caricaturizing in each character, so that everyone is important to the story. Don't spoil your first view by reading the plot or watching trailers. Just watch it and you'll be satisfied through and through."
5.0,"Mar 17, 2025","I thought this movie was brilliant. I'm not usually one for closed captions, but this one is well worth it!"
5.0,"Mar 11, 2025","There is one word and one word only that describes this film and its essence, and that word? ""Perfection"" is that word. I genuinely couldn't find ONE flaw in the film, from cinematography, to wide shots, acting, looks, side characters, this are very few movies that I can 100% say, is AMAZING and PERFECT, and this is one, you've done yourself a distaste by not watching this film"
0.5,"Mar 9, 2025",Didn't make it 30 minutes they first 29 were so painfull. This might be the worst movie ever made. Completely unwatchable.
5.0,"Mar 8, 2025",Incredible!! Defiantly recommend!!
4.5,"Mar 6, 2025",Classic modern day cinematic roller-coaster. What a joy to ride.
5.0,"Mar 6, 2025","This movie has two experiences: that when watching & when remembering. For the first, I felt it's pace slow. But, like the title, it's impact grew within me and lingers still."
5.0,"Mar 4, 2025","Magnificent ! A film that does what very few modern films seem to be able to do: make a highly entertaining film where the social messaging is apparent but it doesn’t overwhelm the rest of the experience. Edgy, dark, funny and devastating."
5.0,"Mar 2, 2025",Perfect Film!!! Simply a Masterpiece!!!!
5.0,"Feb 26, 2025","Brilliant and razor-sharp social critique disguised as a thriller, balancing dark humor, tension, and drama with absolute mastery. Gripping story that exposes class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The film constantly shifts tones and keeps you on edge, making its message hit even harder. In a few words, it’s a cinematic masterpiece that sticks with you long after the credits roll."
2.5,"Feb 25, 2025",It was ok. A bit overhyped IMO. I didn't find any of the characters particularly relatable or likable. The Host was a much more entertaining film by Bong.
4.5,"Feb 25, 2025","Great acting, movie was super interesting. Thought the scheming and the characters felt realistic. Was interesting to see a different world dynamic struggle between the poor and the rich. Top 5 of my movies this year and I wish I had seen it sooner."
5.0,"Feb 20, 2025",I have seen this movie so many times and I never get bored of it. I absolutely recommend it!
5.0,"Feb 20, 2025","A wild story where you find yourself rooting for the villainous underdog. Parasite showcases the divide of classes in South Korea, which is familiar worldwide. Beautifully shot film with lots of heart, suspense, thrills and laughs."
4.5,"Feb 19, 2025",Bong Joon Ho is quite brilliant. It’s the class levels that are becoming the greatest divider of society. Wealth doesn’t insure dignity and class.
5.0,"Feb 12, 2025",This masterpiece about social classes was so intense in the IMAX theater!
4.5,"Feb 12, 2025",All time greatest! Had all the feels...literally all the feels
5.0,"Feb 11, 2025",love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025","I believe it is wonderful how the director is able to transform a seemingly normal beggining into a tenseful film that catches your attention fully. I also must applause the form the movie uses ""unharmful"" scenes to do so, in a way that, little by little, you understand the feeling of complete tiredoom from the poorer family. Absolutily unsettling and extraordinarius!"
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025","Third act was rough, just like every Osgood Perkins movie, but this one has something the others don't, which is incredibly gory deaths and impeccable comedic timing."
1.5,"Feb 10, 2025","I was advised to watch this without learning anything about it, that's what I did, no summary, no trailers. I only knew it won Best Picture so my expectations were high. Unfortunately I was let down big time. I expect to care about characters, I did not care about these. There was no one to root for, no hero, no attachment at all. It was like watching your neighbor's life that you couldn't care less about, drag on and on, until you realize in this case, that the twist and resolution was not meaningful either, as if the writer needed a conclusion and asked around for the most ridiculous ideas, then simply chose one and wrote it in. One review characterized this film as ""vapid"" and I fully agree. A good movie will at least move me emotionally in some way. This didn't do that either."
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025",Uma loucura de bom. Me surpreendeu o desfecho. Simplesmente amei.
5.0,"Feb 10, 2025",Loved it the first 4 times I originally saw it in the theater. ow eve better in IMAX. Keep re-releasing great films like this and I will show up at the theater every week!
5.0,"Feb 9, 2025",A family of con artists. Filled with twists. An all-time favorite. “Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on?”
5.0,"Feb 9, 2025",JUST GO SEE IT IN IMAX
5.0,"Feb 9, 2025","Parasite is the perfect entry way into foreign film. I watched it for the first time during my second year of college. Since Parasite, I have been released into a new world of artistic cinema. The captivating use of lighting, environmental framing, and metaphorical ark makes Parasite critical to the dedicated audience."
5.0,"Feb 8, 2025","Third time watching this film. Incredible. Thrilling, thoughtful, meticulous. Love it."
4.5,"Feb 8, 2025","This movie was amazing, I think you should watch it if you like thrillers that reflect on society and has something new at every turn"
5.0,"Feb 8, 2025",Bong Joon-ho knocked it out of the park with this one. Seeing it in IMAX was especially powerful. Highly recommend.
1.0,"Feb 8, 2025",Boring and stupid. Waste of time.
5.0,"Feb 8, 2025",One of the best films of the decade.
4.5,"Feb 5, 2025","A good example of fiction that inspires introspection, shows social commentary, but also doesn't skimp on dynamic entertainment. In a sea of movies that go through the social media fame and come out the other side as overrated, Parasite sustains its worth."
3.5,"Feb 2, 2025","It’s a compartmentalized concept, somehow expanded to be grander than it needs to be, but it works… and I’m not really sure why."
5.0,"Jan 31, 2025","indeed capitalism made us parasite in some way. love the plot it's actually a crazy one, cinematography and screenplay is amazing truly deserved the Oscar win for International Film Feature and Best Picture! please produce more films like this one, love it sm!"
5.0,"Jan 29, 2025","In the year 2019 it has been a very busy year for films that actually have a seal of approval of films I've watched at that year. Some of which I haven't reviewed apart from three of them such as Little Women, The Gentlemen, Joker, The Irishman, Marriage Story, Uncut Gems, Toy Story 4, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and Avengers: Endgame, now we have a film which is a foreign film that many people including myself really, really love and we'll cherish it forever in years to come and that foreign film is got to be Parasite. Yes, Parasite, one of most anticipated films of all time and one of the memorable ones out there. Many people had difficulty watching it without knowing what they're saying but the subtitles can help them understand and since that this is another foreign film I reviewed I think I should be doing more if I had the chance. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money as they're all unemployed. Min-hyuk, a family friend, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, lie about his education to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich but naïve Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks. Moments later, Kim's family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks for their livelihood until something goes wrong. What makes this film so great is the its masterful blend of social commentary, suspenseful storytelling, complex characters, exceptional cinematography, and a tightly woven plot that explores the stark realities of class inequality, all delivered with a unique blend of dark humor and thrilling twists, making it a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience for viewers from diverse backgrounds. I'll be very honest here, it's not for me doing this review. There are millions of people who actually and giving it highest 5 star or 10/10 making it a much more worthy film even for a foreign film like there are many foreign films that really deserve more praise and never overlook them as a miss and this one is not because it's been loved by so many who love it even this film is on the list of films in Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic, even Letterboxd and I've been thinking: ""Is there any of me doing this review?"" and I know what's done has to be done just like I have to do a lot of movies I'll be doing next time, many which that are great and some of them are bad I have to rant to make you laugh. Like this movie here which is darkly comical unexpectedly. Even if you can understand the ending and everything about this film is immense. With many words to describe this movie, you know exactly what I mean so with that said, Parasite is one of the best films and best foreign films of 2019."
5.0,"Jan 28, 2025","There are just a few directors that have accomplished such a complex and unique combination of feelings, genres and twists, all of these in one movie. Bong Joon-ho did it, and he did it great. It's a movie about capitalism. About that intrinsic sense of belonging and owning, in societies so different, but so alike at the same time. The chemistry and behavior between the characters and their ""plans"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will ask yourself through the whole movie, who is the ""parasite"" of the story. A closer look at a family living in some unfortunate conditions and the contrast with the upper class, and how far will they go to have whatever (they think) they need to be happy."
3.5,"Jan 24, 2025",حلو بس مش واو 70% تقييمى
5.0,"Jan 23, 2025",A masterful movie in every way
3.5,"Jan 22, 2025","The ending is effective but I'm not sure it says much, other than that the disparities between rich and poor are senseless; that they breed mutual enmity out of resentment and indignation, or a sense of effete, supercillious perogative. It's layered, sure. It's also well executed; and in it's own way incisive. But honestly, I don't think it's ultimately saying anything a reasonably intelligent person, with enough life experience hasn't figured out for themselves already. Or maybe I've just been poor for too long? Are you stinking rich? Well, good for you! Watch Parasite. Or don't, no one will care, least of all you, either way. Are you poor? Well, you probably won't be overly impressed. Are you middle-class? Well, no one cares for your opinions of this film, excepting other middle class folk of course. So have at it!"
4.0,"Jan 18, 2025",Parasite isn't the grand treatise on class disparity that people have made it out to be. But it's a great thriller that's just ridiculous enough to keep from being too depressing.
5.0,"Jan 16, 2025","An amazing dark comedy thriller that seamlessly blends clever satire and dreadful tension about class divide and how it forces otherwise good people into a fight for survival by any means necessary. Despite the subtitles, I was so engrossed by the almost-hypnotic visual storytelling, the easily relatable identifiable performances, and the page-turner narrative that constantly keeps you on your toes with not knowing where the story's going yet continuously building upon itself with amazingly brisk pacing despite its 2+ hour runtime. I love how there's so many layers to the themes and even who's the real titular ""parasite"" given all the individual actions vs the root systematic cause of their actions. It's also just genuinely hilarious despite the dark turn it takes. But even that dark turn feels naturally woven into the narrative without feeling like cheap scares for shock value. It's an amazing cinematic experience and easily one of my favorite movies of 2019."
5.0,"Jan 12, 2025",Parasite is one of the best movies ever created. A true masterpiece!!!!
5.0,"Jan 12, 2025","An amazing movie full of twists, turns, never ending surprises, this was a movie I didn't know much about (other than the shortest of summaries and the fact it won the Oscar for best picture). It exceeded all expectations for me."
5.0,"Jan 7, 2025","Bursting with ideas and a complete hodgepodge of genres that all come together quite brilliantly, this is a rare film indeed and a thrill ride to boot."

5.0,"Dec 14, 2024","This film is pure genius. There is nothing imperfect about this movie. It is funny, thrilling, dramatic, and satirical all at once in the best possible way. This movie has so much to say about the way that we think about and treat others and presents these thoughts through and interesting plot, genius dialogue, and amazing acting. This movie is the perfect length and is a constant thrill ride that never really slows down. The ending is amazing and satisfies the viewer in all ways. I am thrilled to see more films by Bong Joon-Ho and am especially excited for Mickey 17 this spring."

4.5,"Dec 2, 2024","Don't get me wrong, this was a great movie but was it the best movie I've seen in years? I wouldn't go that far. Still, the acting was amazing. The cinematography was stellar. The story was great but it wasn't necessarily mind blowing."
0.5,"Nov 29, 2024","Most overrated and overhyped film I've seen in forever. And I was SO up for this film. LITERALLY every other film that was nominated for Nest Picture at the Oscars that this was up against were better than this. It shouldn't have even been nominated! And yes, I DID 'get it' AND understand it, it was still terrible."
4.0,"Nov 22, 2024",Nice casting. Coming with a story that will depict what the society is ideed.
3.0,"Nov 20, 2024","Everyone raves about this movie. I mean YA, I GET IT, ITS GOOD. I just didn't like the way it made me feel. You know? I felt like I was anxious and like I was cringing the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I watched it by myself, but I don't know. Still giving it 3 stars, and you can kick rocks if this rating pisses you off."
3.5,"Nov 18, 2024","It's a nice and high-quality movie to watch. I really liked the course of events, but there were some boring scenes, but I think it's a quality movie with a good progression. It's worth watching."

5.0,"Nov 3, 2024",Incredible film from start to finish. Combines genres and delivers tension without sacrificing a gripping story. Deserves all the accolades and more.
5.0,"Nov 3, 2024","I just finished watching the Film. The first thing I need to say, shouldn't be about the film itself but rather about the feelings within me right after it. I am sure many of you might know the painful feeling of emptiness, one might experience if ones favorite Series, with characters and a Story, you had the chance to bond to over an extensive amount of time and many episodes and seasons, comes to an end. You just feel without a clear goal. It feels like a good friend has died (ok maybe not that bad) and you need to learn what to do with yourself again after having got used to spending all your time with him/her. This was the first movie, that made me feel this way. You might say, that feeling like this might sound like a terrible thing, and in some way it is. But if I personally deeply think about it I would object. This feeling is a wonderful testiment of how great a movie was able to touch the viewers emotion and soul. In a weird philosophical way it is proof of the true humanity of everybody that feels it. I dont think this movies brilliance can be boiled down or be dissected in individual parts like cinematography, characters or story. It is the great sum of all those parts that creates the true brilliance, being the feelings it awakens in its viewers. It perfectly mirrors an each and every humans being in a way. This is why you might feel a rush of those described negative emotions. But if you think about it and feel really deep within yourself...It also awakens the feeling of being understood and a part of a greater, loneliness-expelling community of beings that are in some or another way connected by interest or emotion and therefore possess the ability to archieve wonderful and amazing feats... ...such as creating this movie"

3.0,"Sep 10, 2024","I don’t get the exaggerated hype. Sure, this is one unpredictable plot with great cinematography and performances, sprinkled with an entrancing soundtrack. That makes it far from perfect nonetheless. The first part is tedious and seems elongated, while the second part is not that different, except for a slightly-rushed infamous scene. As a whole, Parasite is peculiar but also somewhat pretentious, and this has nothing to do with the portrayal of a snobbish bunch, but rather with the way through which this snobby-needy juxtaposition is dealt with. In a world of extremes where the ratings for this movie are either 5 stars or just half a star, I choose to take the rocky path, and declare the following: this isn’t a movie one would find oneself itching to watch again any time soon, but it also isn’t one short of standing beside the classics."

Sure there's a little suspense with the basement, but that's about it. I truly did not see the hype on this movie, as a movie buff as well. I watched it in all subtitles, but I don't think that's what killed the experience for me. The plot felt, nonsensical, or rather, inconsequential. The script didn't have any standouts. The character relationships or other character tropes weren't anything special. The only interesting point was seeing how rich people, aren't really aware of their riches, or how other people might look at them / strive to be like them. Is that truly indicative of a bigger scale or just a piece of these characters, who knows."

4.5,"Apr 16, 2024","""Parasite"" stands as a cinematic tour de force, a searing indictment of the socioeconomic disparities entrenched within Korean society. Director Bong Joon-ho masterfully crafts a narrative that pulsates with tension, expertly weaving together themes of class struggle and human desperation. The film's chaotic energy is palpable from start to finish, ensnaring viewers in its gripping tale of deceit and survival. At its core, ""Parasite"" presents a scathing critique of the cavernous divide between the haves and the have-nots, as the destitute Kim family infiltrates the affluent Park household through a web of deception. Each twist and turn in the plot serves to intensify the film's relentless momentum, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats as they grapple with the moral ambiguities laid bare before them. What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to provoke introspection long after the credits have rolled. The film's rich tapestry of characters and layered narrative demand multiple viewings, each unveiling new depths to explore and dissect. Bong Joon-ho's directorial prowess shines brightly, infusing every frame with a sense of urgency and unease that lingers in the mind. In the end, ""Parasite"" transcends the confines of its genre, emerging as a profound meditation on the human condition and the corrosive effects of inequality. It is a cinematic experience that demands to be rewatched, its impact only deepening with each subsequent viewing. In a landscape inundated with mediocrity, ""Parasite"" stands as a beacon of artistic excellence—a film that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on cinema for years to come."

Plenty of other films have expressed the same social criticisms, but it's the exploration of human desperation with extreme authenticity and realism that is so haunting. It's disturbing, yet brilliant, and is what really makes <i>Parasite</i> standout, it exposes the inequalities between social classes, and how it brings out the worst in everyone."

4.5,"Mar 9, 2024","It begins with a family of four from the lower class in Korean society: a father, mother, eldest son, and younger sister. Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film. It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway. While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point. Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality. Moving on to the movie's overall impact, I enjoyed with many emotions and perspectives, but the things that make this movie win so many awards and praise are the analysis and solving of each case and the clear satire of life. If anyone likes this kind of movie, it's certainly one worth watching."

3.5,"Dec 20, 2023","This film is absolutely thrilling, engaging, and contains elements that will grip you throughout its entirety. However, I think there are far better movies from South Korea that I myself have seen recently such as ""A moment to remember,"" & ""Past lives."" They might not be of the same genre, but the previously stated films, mainly ""A moment to remember,"" deserves to be equally acclaimed of not more. Despite lacking thrilling aspects, which most of the time is what forces us to be glued on our sofa expecting every upcoming moments, these movies rely on romance, interesting stories, and subtly reveal concepts that we rarely stumble upon on most movies and series being released these days. The actors are impeccably competent, the excellency of the cinematography is unimaginable, and the sets display visually appealing areas of the Asian continent. This is an area that I think ""Parasite"" must have capitalized on. Gladly, they saved the whole thing with twists and turns, mainly one that makes the 2h12 worth your time."
4.5,"Dec 8, 2023","Saw this in the theater when it came out and then saw it again two days ago. Excellent portrait of rich and poor and, as always with Korean cinema, the innate flaws of humanity and pitfalls of an infinitely imperfect universe. Sometimes the morally superior position is unoccupied because, given the tools the characters have been assigned in life, the morally superior position is exceedingly difficult to compute and/or attain."
3.5,"Dec 6, 2023","The movie Parasite directed by Bong Joon-ho was released on October 11, 2019. This movie started Lee Sun-kyun, Park So-dam, and Choi Woo-Shink. The movie starts off with a poor family living in a home in Seoul. They manage to work for a rich family and soon get to enjoy the rich life status once their bosses leave. The movie takes a turn and involves science that some may consider violent. As the poor family is at the rich families home, the poor families home gets flooded. Kim Ki-woo, the son of the poor family is trying to get his family out of their poorness and just wants to be apreciated by them so he tries everything he can to get them a wealthier life. SPOILER: During the flood he reaches for the rock which his family thought was worthless while Kim Ki-woo knew it had value. He saves the rock and gets out the home. Overall This movie is entertaining but may be confusing fro some."
5.0,"Dec 3, 2023","""It keeps clinging to me"" Parasite will be remembered for generations. Every frame is a painting and, despite its harrowing depiction of the damages of classism, a shared struggle emerges which is, simply put, human. Anyway, fun stuff!"
4.5,"Nov 22, 2023","Parasite, dark and satirical, reflects society's corruption in class struggle. The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come. The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties. (ESHS Film Club- Yumna Khan, Jonah Gardiner, Stevon, Sonia C)"

2.5,"Sep 8, 2023","My first review on rotten tomatoes lol. I wasn't really enjoining most of the film as I'm really sensitive person. I don't like such films where people lye and the whole film is circulated about the false which will come truth in the end. But I really like that this film leaded me to understand the truth that I can't reach. It's the inability to find a job. As a part of a western world I have founded myself in the beginning of the film as ""hey you why can't you just find any job to survive?"" Then I came to understanding that this is another world in South Korea. Also I don't like open endings so I'm writing it because of it 🤠"

4.5,"Aug 30, 2023","Parasite is definitely a ""must see"" film in 2019, and is often regarded as Bong Joon-ho's most influential masterpiece of a black-comedy, who also directed the acclaimed films such as Snowpiercer, Okja, Memories of Murder, and The Host, and the first Korean film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. This plot centers about the unemployed destitute Kim clan who pretend to be highly-qualified individuals by infiltrating the wealthy Park family.."

5.0,"Aug 18, 2023","Incredibly smart and detailed screenwriting and direction. The build up is a ride that keeps getting higher and higher until it eventually starts to drop into chilling thrills and it delivers more than expected. Well crafted climaxes. It feels pretty insane and dramatic, but it still knows how to be humourous. The cinematography and music is fantastic and highlights the storytelling very well, while the cast is brilliant and convincing on their part during the whole act. The editing is very clever and engaging. The use and timing of the slow motion dramatizes scenes just perfect. The script is flawless. The sets compliment the narrative and create a great contrasts between the two families. The flooding scene looked pretty good, including the explosive toilet. There's seemingly no scene that feels out of place. Nothing in this movie went to waste. A masterpiece."

4.0,"Jun 26, 2023",A fresh and original story that moves along at a steady and well-balanced pace with more than a couple surprises along the way.
3.5,"Jun 17, 2023","This is s very good movie. What makes it so is it presents very complex relationships in a simplified, limited sets environment. There is an intimacy to the proceedings, and this augments the comedic aspect as well. The acting is efficient and effective. The one drawback is the two dimensional characters; presented as absolute versions of rich and poor. In other words, you're either on this side or that side. That is not to say that there are not people that act and think this way. It all seems very convenient and you can predict character reactions. There is no warmth or sympathy between the families. No personal connections, with everyone being disposable and blind to one another. They pursue their own self interests without ethics or morality. Either a hustler or very gullible. However, as a black comedy this can work and it does so throughout the movie. It is a movie that must be thought about, considering each layer like Matryoshka Dolls. Class interactions causing intra-class dichotomies and violence. A very harsh movie on its own characters. I have watched it more than once. I pick up something new or a new idea about the film with each viewing. Exactly the effect a thinking movie should have on its audience."
5.0,"Jun 17, 2023","One of the best movies ever. It's just perfect. Not much needs to be but perfect plot, acting, characters, shots, directing, just everything. It was a truly enjoyable and unforgettable experience and is a film that everyone should definitely watch."

5.0,"Jun 7, 2023",Best Korean movie of all time.
5.0,"Jun 7, 2023","The first half of the film is darkly humorous, with a family living in a basement lying and framing the driver and housekeeper in an effort to work for the rich. When I saw the first half, I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Until they see rich people go camping, but the Jin family actually live in the mansion, eat and drink, and completely consider themselves rich. It makes me uncomfortable to see this because it is ""greed"". They want to make money. That's normal. But to enjoy a life of utter hypocrisy is ""greed"". Seeing the heavy rain, I thought the host family would come back. The good part of the movie is the return of the old butler. The turning point of the film is the scene leading to the basement. From this moment on, this is no longer a comedy. It became a conspiracy, a bigger lie, a fight for life. I thought that the Jin family has parasitic in the rich family, did not think that the old housekeeper and her husband is a bigger parasite. After watching this movie, I always wonder what I would have done if I was living in a basement, working for a rich man. I will definitely work hard to make money, change a better house, and then through this job to find a better job for myself. That should be most people's plan. The Jin family, although very smart, also very good at work. But they are lazy, do not make progress, do not have a plan, and do not seek to change the status quo. So they would rather be parasites and feel inferior than change the status quo. The lesson of this film is that if you are not satisfied with your life, you must find a way to improve the quality of your life, because you can!"
3.0,"May 31, 2023","It was entertaining but not mind-blowingly good as many western critics indicated. Part of the confusion is caused by western critics who seem to be evaluating the plot's shock value based on a European/western 3-act structure instead of the 4-act Asian structure. This movie plot follows the latter and is consistent with the timing and expected twists and turns of that structure. After accounting for the 4-act structure, this plot is not as shocking or surprising as western critics seem to think. Instead, it takes the expected twists & turns in the expected order, which reduces its shock value. Still, it's an entertaining way to pass a few hours."

3.5,"Mar 31, 2023","Overrated is the operative word. This is a year that gave us Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917, JoJo Rabbit, all of which I believe were far stronger accomplishments. Regardless of that, this is a good film, at times very good, but there's nothing that merits the hoopla other than a foreign film being the the esoteric darling of that year's Hollywood cultural mentality about cultural mentalities. Parasite isn't worth vaccinating against, but its overactive accolades were a bit pestilential."

Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities.

2.0,"Oct 28, 2022","A tedious mediocrity for a so called ""masterpiece"", Parasite is one of those movies you go into expecting a walk on the red carpet experience especially for a Critic Apprentice like me none of over sort happened and snacks were not provided so I had to begrudgingly hark over $20 for a popcorn. Surely this couldn't get any worse but as the light went dim and the projector starting whirling I stared in pure baffling awe as the movie wasn't even in English no seriously who would have left such a grave technical error in the final product. I had to squint and read the tiny text at the bottom surely damped my mood. This movie was only made to hate on rich people which is insensitive because they are only using the fruits of their labor to live their everyday lives. I find it Ironic that these ""top critics"" shower this movie with praise when they themselves are money hungry worms, how upsetting.,"

5.0,"Oct 11, 2022","Director Bong Joon Ho has always been preoccupied with socioeconomic disparity, but he takes it to an entirely different level with Parasite. When the impoverished Kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy Park family, life for both families spirals out of control, resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror. Parasite is a film truly unlike any other, an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses. Bong Joon Ho, a master of visuals, frames and blocks every shot meticulously. Humor is perfectly balanced with suspense, all while remaining faithful to his theme. Parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not the best."

4.5,"Sep 6, 2022",a very good but not absolutely incredible movie. uses symbolism the most very well. very good storytelling through visuals
2.5,"Sep 5, 2022","Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics. Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact. The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible. It will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons. Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre. Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."
4.5,"Sep 2, 2022","shocking to see so many korean actors in a korean film of course, where's your diversity ? The film was very good with interesting social commentary, but I did find it a little absurd in places and the ending wasn't for me"
4.5,"Sep 1, 2022","This is a tense and somewhat unsettling film, which is thrilling and claustrophobic at times. Its certainly a multi-layered plot that builds up slowly. I wouldn't want to say anymore so as not to provide any potential spoilers. Its not clear from the start what's going to happen and it's a film that's likely enjoyed more if you don't have too many pre-conceptions. Its certainly quite a memorable film. I wouldn't say it's the most thought provoking film I've ever seen by any means but it is pretty thoughtful, in terms of the general societal themes covered. I would certainly recommend it if your keen on world cinema and like to watch films that keep you guessing."
5.0,"Aug 28, 2022","Der Film ist eine Mischung von Schauspiel, Thriller, Gleichnis, Posse, Karikatur und Komödie. Und spielt das soziale Ungleichgewicht in Süd-Korea und sogleich der Welt an. Bong Joon-ho schrieb das Drehbuch mit Han Jin-won, und sogleich führte auch Bong Joon-ho die Regie. Der Film ist perfekt inszeniert, er ist mit spürbarer Liebe ausgestattet, und mit Können gestaltet. Selbst die Filmmusik ist mit Modernen und Klassischen Elementen bestückt. Für mich ist der Film mit seinen Darstellern in aller Hinsicht Perfekt und des Lobes würdig, ein Genuss für die Augen und für die Ohren."
4.5,"Aug 24, 2022",Brilliant satire-thriller with great characters and story. However that underwhelming climax wasn't delivered as good and slick as the rest of the film.
2.5,"Aug 20, 2022","Parasite isn't as good as what people say it is. Spoilers ahead. Bong Joon-ho's career has potential, but that's about it. The movie had a good enough plot to draw me in, but it became predictable after a while. As soon as I realized its predictability, it became quite boring, and don't even get me started with its ""twist."" There was always something shady about the maid, mostly because we knew a bit about everyone else besides her, so I knew she wasn't just a maid. The basement is the movie's biggest plot hole. I think that's because, if a wealthy South Korean bought a house, wouldn't they have one as their first concern? During the film's twist, Mun-Kwang mentions exactly what I said, even mentioning the creditors, but then he goes on to say: ""Maybe Mr. Namgoong felt embarrassed about building such a room. He didn't mention it to the Parks when he sold the house."" The conclusion here strikes me as lazy. A major concern people have with this film is the message it conveys. It conveys that rich people have a perfect life, a life of innocence and gullibility. Rich people aren't as innocent as they appear from what I have seen from the majority of rich people. Their gullibility is a result of believing everything the Kim Family tells them. Yes, it's said they will take anyone who gets recommended by a friend after talking to them, interviewing them, perhaps asking for some papers, and then believing them. People who are rich often feel they don't have all the money in the world, and they need more money to live a happy life. It seems absurd to me to think that way. There is always a tendency for someone to exaggerate when recommending someone to another person. It would be impossible to truly know this person, even in the interview, if they were not exaggerating when they were being interviewed, and they may have some past job offers and great school degrees, but how would you trust someone being recommended to you? It's truly disgusting how they convey that poor people will do whatever it takes to survive, even drive themselves to murder, which isn't the solution to their problem. Regardless of whether it's seen through the lens of a foreign country's economics, it shouldn't be portrayed at all. The ending really rubs me in the wrong way with just a straight up killing spree. The motives of all the characters' are all over the place, but this is by far the worst ending coming behind Spiral, just for its shock value."

5.0,"Aug 14, 2022",One of the best movies I’ve ever seen.
5.0,"Aug 14, 2022","A haunting pitch black comedy that thoroughly skewers the dog eat dog world of capitalism. It leaves you feeling lost in the fog of who the real parasite is: the poor who must violently contend against each other and fight dirty for a chance to suckle off the teat of the rich, or the rich who are infantilized by their own wealth into a selfish helplessness on which they survive off the labors of those they keep in destitution. The twists kept me on the edge of my seat, while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds. All of this brings you to an ending so bleak, it highlights the faults in a system where the only way to live is without direction, as any plan is folly in the face of where you are born under capitalism."
1.5,"Aug 14, 2022","Parasite is like a Boeing 777 taking off vertically, soaring high, losing velocity, and falling to earth in a raging fireball. In other words, I've seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie, or so let down by the last 2. What makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp, fairy-tale structure of the plot, offering glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe, filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling. The Kim family's takeover of a palatial hillside home, or at least the downstairs bit, is a joy to behold. It follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation, as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood. No problem: Mrs. Kim, with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an ""art therapist,"" is right on hand to fill the spot. Despite the folktale vibe, there's plenty of nuance too. We are not invited to simply pity the destitute Kims or to despise the complacent Parks. Somewhere midway through, Mr. Kim shares his life's store of wisdom with his son: planning things out is a waste of time, and whatever happens, happens. What can you do? With such a patriarch, it's not hard to see how the Kims have made themselves desperately poor. Equally reprehensible is the Kims' outlook toward the Parks, whom they dehumanize as gullible marks. Meanwhile, the Parks are presented as clean, organized, and essentially decent. Mrs. Park, despite her emotional imbalance, is particularly winsome, and you flinch when the Kims call her an idiot behind her back. Unfortunately, all of this nuance is lost by the end. Other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie, but I would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks. In seeing Mr. Kim, hired as a chauffeur, forced to don an Indian headdress for a birthday party, we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world. In seeing his neighborhood flooded with sewage after heavy rains, we are to understand that the very structure of the world keeps him wallowing in filth. And when, while Mrs. Park is driven on a lengthy shopping tour, we see her feet stretched toward the front seat alongside Mr. Kim's face, we are to gather that he is at the family's mercy. This kind of ham-fistedness reveals the severe limits of socialist comprehension; it cannot really get at the human condition. When the story ends in a bloodbath, you know it's gone off the rails in a bad way. It's not merely the loss of structure or the conflation of genres that bothers me; it's the draining of expansiveness and humanity."
4.5,"Aug 10, 2022","The direction, the cinematography and the visual messages in general are just incredible well-done. The story is perfectly constructed, making this both a really dynamic and deep film."
5.0,"Aug 8, 2022","WOW! Easily one of the best films I've ever seen. A must watch. Its a comedy, drama, and thriller all roled into one. Amazing story telling and character development. If you haven't seen it, cancel your plans and watch it tonight."
3.5,"Aug 8, 2022","good drama, lot's of symbolism, witch i love."
1.0,"Aug 7, 2022",A movie that glorifies stealing from and killing of honest folks. It worries me that this sad ultra-left fetish received such high praise.
5.0,"Aug 3, 2022","The overall high level of quality is very apparent, the movie is excellently staged, shot and directed. The story also moves at a very efficient pace, it's fast but every scene adds to the story, and it slows down when it needs to. Parasite is truly gripping, partially due to its structure, and it uses both humor, and tension expertly. The films message is clearly conveyed, not only through the characters and their actions, but also very much through the cinematography. There are some nice dichotomies that separate rich and poor – light and dark, clean and dirty, and high and low."

5.0,"Jul 16, 2022","Parasite is one of the few movies you will find where I don't have a single critique to give. From start to finish the experience keeps you hooked with an innovative plot that was acted perfectly by the cast. It's well deserving of its acclaim and deserves your attention for one sitting, without a doubt one of the best films, not just of 2019, but to ever be created. Bravo Bong Joon Ho, bravo"

5.0,"Jun 28, 2022","La película perfecta para cerrar la década. Esta joya de suspenso y comedia negra surcoreana dirigida por el casi visionario Bong Joon-ho, es más que solo la mejor película de 2019, es un fenómeno sensacional de la industria. Saltando de un género al otro, ""Parasite"" (2019) realmente sorprende con su inteligente humor, reflexión ante los temas de interacciones y clases sociales, y dándole una vuelta de tuerca a la trama un par de veces. Las emociones de la película adoptan nuevos grados de intensidad por minuto (el pulso cardiaco también), apoyando todos los géneros que representa, así como paralelamente los temas preocupantes que hay en su escena. Sus numerosas nominaciones a los Óscar aseguran su título como futuro clásico, principalmente por el logro de ser la primera película de idioma no ingles que gana el premio a Mejor Película. Este es un tipo bienvenido de parásito que no se va de mi cabeza, y creo que muchas personas que la vieron van a estar de acuerdo al respecto."
5.0,"Jun 25, 2022","I sat down to watch this movie with my dad, who has poor eyesight, can't read subtitles very quickly, and usually falls asleep halfway through movies. He was riveted throughout the whole movie. The plot is so satisfying and suspenseful. The climax was upsetting and really made me think. There is so much to analyze about this movie. The ending was so perfect too."
5.0,"Jun 23, 2022","With a brilliant mix of genres, Parasite manages to touch, surprise, frighten and chuckle with flawless acting, immaculate cinematography and a deeply enthralling story that honors its audience proving Bong Joon-ho's masterful command in the art of filmmaking."
2.0,"Jun 20, 2022","This is a mediocre movie. I didn't enjoy it at all—it was just weird. Not funny, and not satisfying. Very violent. Worst Best Picture winner I have ever seen by far."
5.0,"Jun 17, 2022","""Parasite"" captures you from start to finish. It's engaging, thought-provoking with its premise, captivating with its performances and music score, and somehow manages to handle the tones of humour, drama, mystery, thriller suspense without them conflicting, all wrapped into one film. One of the best of the decade, and a well-deserved Oscar win."
2.5,"Jun 14, 2022","What an interesting movie. I don't really know what to think of it, to be honest, that's why I gave it a 2.5 out of 5. It had an interesting plot at the beginning with them all taking over the house but it began to get gruesome and weird towards the end. The ending was just crazy. I don't know if I would recommend this movie or if it is as great as everyone makes it out to be."

5.0,"May 5, 2022","Outstanding Cinema. This is a much watch. It has all the ingredients of a classic film — humor, sadness, excitement, despair and hope. I'm not sure exactly who is the parasite though since the story does a great job of not turning any of its characters into a villain. Does a great job of displaying the contrast between abject poverty and extreme wealth and how classism plays out and ends in tragedy."

5.0,"May 3, 2022","When I finished Parasite, I called my best friend. ""Have you seen this movie??"" I asked, to which he replied, ""No"". ""You NEED to see this movie"" I urged. There isn't much more to say. If you still haven't seen Parasite, you NEED to see it."
5.0,"May 1, 2022","Amazing thriller, it will make you think what would happen next throughout the entire film and will still make you wonder what might have happened next even after film ends."
4.5,"Apr 30, 2022","Full of surprises, humor, and social commentary, it ultimately ends with deep pathos. Nothing is what it seems, and it ends up being even more so. It seems fairly light and what will turn out to be more a caper than what it becomes, which is a hammer over the head. A very impressive film that will keep you thinking long after it's over. Deeply affecting."

5.0,"Apr 6, 2022","Parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece. Having won many awards at the 92nd Academy Awards like Best International Feature Film, this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting, cinematography, and its relatability. Based in Korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the Kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned. Parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall, creating such believable families. The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting. Its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a must-watch alongside its technical aspects. It's an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally. All these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience, which makes it stand above the rest."
0.5,"Apr 4, 2022","This is one of the worst moves I have ever seen. It's boring, and the premise is ridiculous. I read a whole bunch of reviews to try to find out what I was missing. The reviews made no sense. This is an example of a movie people think they're supposed to like so they do."

3.5,"Feb 27, 2022","Entertaining *dark* scatterbrain comedy, that goes off waaay into the weeds at the 3/4 mark. Works, makes sense - you root for the Kim's - until the bizarre events of toward the end. Those choices seem somewhat contrived, and out of character for characters that have repeatedly demonstrated themselves as bright, and capable of 'passing for hardworking smarter-than-everyone-else competent people', for extended periods of time to get and keep their target jobs. Truthfully though, this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy, intoxicated underachievers, that can't consistently even fold boxes with any consistency, who suddenly and miraculously pull 'smart choices', and super-spy-level skills and talents out of seeming 'nowhere'. I think it misses somewhat in the 'capitalism is the problem' angle, widely pitched, as the Kims are clearly very capable and motivated, and can achieve amazing things, when they apply themselves, but seem to have arrived at their semi-basement apartment - and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes - through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia. Recommended, just not as satisfying as I'd hoped."
5.0,"Feb 24, 2022","Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages.

The third act is easily the most entrancing 30-45 minutes of a film I've ever seen. Things begin to change, and they change quickly. I'm not trying to say too much because I don't want to spoil ANYTHING Parasite has the greatest ending I've ever seen in a film. And that's genuine. Seriously, no words.

5.0,"Feb 5, 2022","Parasite was a wonder to behold. The movie contained wonderful cinematography throughout, from glorious, smooth, long shots, to excellent handheld work. The film's superb visual architecture and design conveyed layers of meaning, accentuated by an incredible cast. And ultimately, though what Parasite has to say might not be anything new, it conveys it's story of class divide in a superb manner. In the end though, what stood out above all, was the sheer attention to detail. 99/100"

4.5,"Jan 17, 2022",This Movie was Wild. I am usually not a fan of subtitles but this movie was fantastic. if you are up for a mind game that is somehow relatable and realistic. with a Tarantino twist and ode with a gruesome ending to the movie- simply leaves you with your jaw dropped. Wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. with the right kind of suspense and curiosity this movie was solid! would recommend.
4.0,"Jan 17, 2022","Parasite deserves its awards. It's unique, refreshing and innovative. It is well-paced and well-acted. It would make you laugh with its witty plot and dialogues.

2.0,"Jan 13, 2022","Disturbing. That's the first word that comes to mind. I appreciate disturbing movies when they teach me something or make me reflect but honestly I don't get why so much fuss about this one. I see the point about it highlighting the inequalities between rich and poor people and the fact that poor people would go to some length to improve their status but I didn't find that there was anything deeper than that. Perhaps some of the images slightly symbolical, ie. poor people living in the basement below the rich and the family's dad killing a bug (ie. 'parasite') at the start, but that's the easiest kind of symbols one can come up with. I totally don't get the fuss. What am I missing?"
5.0,"Jan 10, 2022","Bong Joon-ho keeps stepping up his game with every movie he directs: The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013), Okja (2017). And now the Palme d'Or winning movie: Parasite (2019). This movie contains wonderful pacing. It is a slow cooker with an explosive face-off in the final act. The humor scattered throughout the story is a perfect way to ease the tension before the characters cannot stand it anymore."

Bong Joon-ho and his masterpiece Parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts. What I loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang, the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist. The music is beautiful, the writing is brilliant, and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous. Parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come."

3.5,"Nov 21, 2021","Warning: SPOILERS It's possible that I watched this movie with my expectations too high. The way most critics wrote about this movie I was literally expecting something mind blowing. Well… it was…good. The first hour or so was really barely okay. This involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants' jobs. Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right? Well, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene. So add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?"

No estaba seguro de qué esperar, pero la trama, los giros, la reflexión ante los temas de interacción entre clases sociales, la fotografía, su mensaje final, la dirección, las actuaciones; todo es excelente. También tiene algunos toques de humor muy bien implementados. En conjunto toda la película es muy entretenida por lo que es muy fácil de ver y no te vas a aburrir para nada. Me gusta que es original y mezcla varios géneros diferentes. No entra en ningún molde, si bien hace guiños a películas clásicas, me parece muy original. En conclusión, una excelente película que creo yo todos deberían ver porque es genial y su final te termina impactando. Muy recomendada."

Would recommend if you enjoy film and something different."
5.0,"Sep 18, 2021","Parasite movie is outstanding. It has many levels, great detail and a fresh, even harsh look at the rich-poor divide in the world today. Some scenes evoke Tarantino's signature, but it is made in the best tradition of Japanese movie art. You cannot stop to think about this film even next day. Every body must see it and think about our wrong world where one part lives in prosperity and the other part struggles restlessly to survive."
3.0,"Sep 14, 2021","Since it received the 2020 Best Picture Academy award, I felt compelled to watch the film despite the fact that it was sub-titled with no English overdub or Audio Description.

I'm not sure it was worthy of best picture, though."

I really enjoyed the peek into Korean culture, or at least what I assume to be Korean culture. It's fresh and different. It blends seriousness and comedy very well, and it's definitely up there for movies I've seen. I'm not entirely sure about the message itself. I rarely find that movies can deliver a stellar message, like a book can, as they don't seem to have enough time. But it's very entertaining and worth re-watching, which I wouldn't say about too many movies."
5.0,"Sep 11, 2021","This was quite a film, the outturning events are rather very unexpected yet somehow plausible, you can't possibly predict the ending from its beginning. the characters actions were messed up and led to their deteriorating eventually, but we tend to not focus on the circumstances that led to those actions, It's perhaps the inevitable damage emerging out of endless desperation."

5.0,"Aug 28, 2021","What a rollercoaster. The first thing that stood out was the cinematography and environments in this film which are gorgeous. The structure of the story is subtle and peels away layers as its interesting characters become more involved in the plot. The music elegantly heightens the tone of this film too. The film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in Korean culture. People leeching off of others is apparent. The social commentary here is blatant. Karma is a thing. But what I felt resonated most was the importance of family. The theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes. Bong Joon Ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today, but in a way that will not become dated. Parasite is a weave of dark tones, intrigue, mystery, and humour, and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today."

5.0,"Jul 19, 2021","Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script. The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful. Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10"
5.0,"Jul 11, 2021","'Parasite' is an incredible, thrilling, suspenseful, twisty, sophisticated film. Not one moment on screen is wasted when this exciting plot is unfolding.

5.0,"Jul 6, 2021","Wow, this family is so poor that they don't even live on ground level, they live below the street, below society. I like the mother, she's sassy and doesn't give a damn to speak her mind. Wow, that place is like a fortress. It's so beautiful, pristine like a palace. It looks like it doesn't even belong in the city. Something's kind of fishy with this huge house and it's inhabitants and I'm very curios as to what happens. I've noticed from watching several Korean movies, that they have a really good sense of humor. Almost very random and unexpected when it happens. The madame is quite attractive, she's cute. She's also very lively and has a great sense of humor. Hmm, that wall illuminating all the dishes and kitchen ware seems important, very interesting. These poor kids are really street smart, what they lack in wealth, they may up for with wits and grit. Fake it till you make it I guess is their motto. Wow, I don't know what to think about this poor family. Their motives and their plan is quite diabolical. They've basically gotten rid of all the help the rich family had. They even got rid of the housekeeper who seemed like a nice older lady. They seem kind of scum baggy to me, they're scummy people. I'm beginning to think that this poor family isn't a family at all and maybe they like work for the same company or person or something? Dude wtf is going on? Lol! There's this underground room where the old housekeeper's husband is living down there? Dude this is so fucking weird. I can't believe they got away with that escape. Holy shit, that was butt clenching. It's at this moment that the movie shifts into a completely different direction and even changes in mood and genre becoming more of a thriller/horror. It seems like the main theme is this movie is lies and deception. What you see, isn't really what you get and you can't really trust just about anyone, even if they're recommended by a reliable source. It's very odd to watch unfold, but this poor family has basically integrated themselves into the lives of this rich family. I guess they're all parasites feeding off this rich family. I don't know why but now I feel like the rich family is going to do something unexpected. I feel like there's going to be some kind of fucked up twist that's going to happen. They were the stink bugs all along, the lower class, the poor. There was a lot of twisted moments from both families. Beautifully filmed. The cinematography and compositions are impeccable. A feat of technical perfection. Brilliantly and cleverly written. Masterfully executed and filled with plenty of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. My only problem with the movie is that it's hard to relate to any of the characters since they're all essentially parasites and they all have really scummy characteristics to them, both the poor and the rich families. I guess I could relate the most to the rich families son and daughter. Watching this movie movie was something very exciting and thrilling, I didn't know what to expect next. I would definitely watch this movie again."

5.0,"Apr 24, 2021","This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek's house. He lives on an ""intermediate floor"", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror. Director Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man's house, the poor's middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park's wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict. The first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park's innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens. Fortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways. Finally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss's hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a ""subway smell"") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, ""gourmet balconies"", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live. When the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: ""What would Min do in this situation?"", he asks. Her sister replies: ""Min would never be in this situation"". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war."

4.5,"Apr 20, 2021","Normally I'm not much into Korean entertainment. The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched. Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house. Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding The only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal. Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come."

4.0,"Apr 17, 2021","The movie is very important by reporting the social inequality, seen in the big differences between the houses in which the two families live, the employments of the both, how life is easilier to the rich family e all the difficulties that the poor family has to deal with. Another thing very well expressed in the movie are the selfishness of the dominant class, when after the man hided in the basement be killed, all the boss have to say is about the ""poor smell"" of the man that had just lost his life. Also, the movie handles very well that belonging to the dominant class brings some symbols, as the rich family daugher's access to foreign language classes, and the youngest son's access to art classes. And, in addition, rely on the services of more than one domestic employee. My only reservation about the movie is that it's history would be better exploited if it proposed a collective response to the social inequality, and not as response to it the social ascension of few people, which is desired by the poor family soon. That way, he would save his father that stayed at the rich house's basement. Finally, the actor's performances and the script are very well directed, knowing when to give the drama tone or even the comedy tone, when it was necessary."

5.0,"Mar 27, 2021","Parasite is a film that is both a joy and cringe fest at the same time. It is masterfully crafted in a way that you can't help but be gripped by the actions taking place on screen. This is a story about two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum that end up colliding their very different Worlds in a dramatic and somewhat shocking way. We are introduced to the Kim family in their dreary semi basement home , hunting for WiFi and opening windows to gain from free bug killing street fumigation. In contrast the Park family live a privilege life who turn their noses up at the smell of people who ride the subway. The way this film builds the tension and blends both humour with tragedy is nothing short of amazing. The story,  albeit , a well told tale of master and servants,  twists and turns to ensure you never see the ending coming.  It took only minutes for me to forget Parasite was a foreign language film as it quickly pulls you into the narrative and keeps you engaged throughout the film.

5.0,"Mar 16, 2021","THE PERFECT DECEIT Every now and then a phenomenon appears in the world. The movie world is no exception. I know that the Oscars are one of the most popular events, but let's be honest, everyone who is even a bit interested in the beauty of cinema knows well that the Cannes festival really awards world-class works. For example, last year's winner of the festival ""Parasite"". After watching the movie myself I understood why. Bong Joon-ho is distinguished by extraordinary originality in his movies. ""Snowpiercer"" or ‘Okja' are pure evidence that this director never repeats himself. He will always surprise us with a new story, completely different from the others, with something astounding about it. His new work ""Parasite"" also belongs to this canon, but this time Bong Joon-Ho presents us with a story that surpasses all previous sensational achievements of the Korean. This should be a review, not a spoiler, so I will try to describe the plot of this masterpiece as simple as possible. Let's start with the fact that the main characters are a poor Korean family (parents and two young adult children) living in a musty basement. The movie starts with a great misfortune, the wi-fi password was changed in a local area and the family loses access to the Internet. At some point we can all relate to this little ‘catastrophe'. Sooner or later thanks to a friend's recommendation the family's son, finds a job as an English tutor to a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He quickly starts implementing a plan that will allow him to get his sister and parents to work for the rich. At this point, it felt like the entire movie was supposed to be a comedy of contrasting poor and rich families, and seeing the poor struggling to stay afloat. But don't worry the movie is about more than that. Most of the things that happen as the story unfolds are unpredictable. The unconventional creator doesn't give everything up on the plate right away. Parasite starts off as a comedy, we have a lot of black humor here, incredible plot twists, the scenes are erratic and the tension keeps growing. It is impossible to guess what's going to happen at the very end or even in the next few moments. And on top of all this, Bong Joon-Ho shows us one of the biggest issues of the world: the differences between rich and poor. Not only the script and direction in Parasite is excellent. The whole thing looks great in every possible way. The shots and music are a real feast for the senses, and the way the camera is operated makes us get to know the Park house like our own pocket. In addition, we also get a small look on a poor Korean town, which in my opinion may interest the European viewer. Also the cast of this movie did a stunning job. Parasite is told in a modern, poetic, light and daring way. This piece of art devours the spectator, does not cause any problems with assimilation, and at the same time is an absolutely refined work at the highest level. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie. It hides a lot of variety that you will not notice at first glance. It has an intriguing story, combines humor with seriousness and the both family's cannot be seen as good or bad. ""Parasite"" is an extremely courageous movie that touches on social stratification, and it does it in a daring manner it amuses and moves. Bong again provided great entertainment for us."

4.5,"Mar 11, 2021","Parasita é fantástico. É inteligente. É engraçado. É perturbador. E sim, há um poderoso tema subjacente à divisão entre ricos e pobres. Mas o último é tão habilmente entrelaçado na trama da história que você realmente não pensa muito sobre isso até uma cena fatídica antes do último ato. Ele mereceu totalmente o Oscar de Melhor Filme e Diretor. Ao menos para a cena de luta de fuzz de pêssego."

5.0,"Mar 7, 2021",Bong Joon-Ho at his best. Parasite is a masterpiece of modern film.
5.0,"Mar 5, 2021","Parasite is a satire movie, it tell that no one is perfect. Rich people can be fool and the poor can be smart. Everyone can do everything for their life even though they know that it is not right. The villain is not Park's family but it is the unfair society. It is the system that always helps and support the rich people and this system makes to the poor can't rise. Every scene is like a art, the audience can feel how they separate the class of the rich and the poor in one frame. And the soundtrack is very minimal but it is very emotional."
5.0,"Mar 5, 2021","Parasite, a new work by the famous Korean director Feng Junhao This movie keeps the audience engaged and emotionally invested from start to finish. This is a movie release since 2019 but I watched it during the pandemic last year I would say this is another few Korean movies that I want to give a high evaluation. The plot of the film revolves around a poor family and a rich family. At the beginning of the movie, the focus is on a Kim family of four in the basement of Seoul. Mom and dad are unemployed, kids are out of school. One day, Kim family's son was hired to be a tutor for the daughter of a rich family, Park Family and then he tried to let his family pretend as the highly qualified person and they successfully parasitized in the rich family while the rich family is quite unaware. This is a very novel movie. The plot of the movie is quite different from what I have seen before. It can make reflected modern society and let people thought-provoking. In this movie, no one is a one hundred percent perfect angle or a full demon everyone using obscure means but they just wanted to achieve their goals. There's a lot of contrast and reversal in the movie. The plot is very compact, with many unexpected developments. The contrast between the dark and the light side, the contrast between the mansion and the basement, and so on. There are a lot of details to savor, and maybe a few more. I enjoy all the actor's performance they do a great job in emphasizing the little nuances which make each of the personalities unique and I would say there is no redundant lens. In this film each scene, in the beginning, is the preparation for the following plot. At the end of the movie, ""the poor"" finally becomes ""the rich"" and leads a good life through their efforts, but all this is imagined by ""the poor"". Maybe the reality is so cruel, many things, imagine is very good, but no action, no effort, it will never become true. If you can only watch one movie I'm extremely recommended this wonderful masterpiece for you, this Plame d'Or winner of the Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint you."
4.0,"Mar 5, 2021","""Parasite"" is one of my favorite movies. Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real ""parasite class""? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more. In the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain."

5.0,"Feb 26, 2021","A blisteringly prescient, radically original cinematic study of class warfare. Bong Joon-ho cements his position as one of the 21st Century's best working directors, and possibly of all time. His grip (as well as co-screenwriter Han Jin-won) on the story, characters, settings, and actions is unrivaled in its deceptive simplicity that belies an intense, impeccably-crafted, undeniably compelling complexity that treats its characters with wit, cunning, and intelligence. Song Kang-ho is phenomenally powerful in his supporting role, with other standout performances coming from Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam. Razor-sharp cinematography, eye-catching production design, and a wonderfully flavorful musical score add significantly to what is already a profoundly affecting, narratively singular experience. A perfect blend of dark humor, trenchant social commentary, popcorn thrills, and emotional poignancy, Parasite is not only the best film of 2019, not only one of the best films of the decade, but, as its characters attempt to accomplish, an entry into the upper echelon of all-time greats and classics."

4.5,"Feb 22, 2021","An expertly crafted film that never feels forced or unnecessary, gorgeous shots fill this frame to frame it is expertly acted.

5.0,"Feb 13, 2021","It's not difficult to comprehend why this film was so successful at the most recent Academy Awards. Every scene is filled with so much depth and emotion, and the story transcends the limits of any one genre. A thought-provoking portrayal of class, wealth and family, Parasite single-handedly opened up to me the world of foreign-language cinema, proving that some of the best films of the coming decade won't necessarily be in English."
5.0,"Feb 8, 2021",A rollercoaster of emotions. I cried when I finished it because of how overwhelmed I was and how much I loved it.
3.0,"Feb 8, 2021","As a Korean, I can tell you that compare to other Korean films, this is average at best. It won the Oscar only because it is one piece of liberal propaganda for socialism. If you want to watch real good Korean movies, try The Taxi Driver, based on the real Gwanju uprising as Koreans fought for democracy."
4.5,"Feb 7, 2021","The unique aspects which the movie had were interesting. For me, I enjoyed most of Joon-ho Bong's movies, but Parasite is my personal favorite. This is because it makes the audience think while watching. Lots of people come up with different perspectives and that widens the view of the movie. Also, using expressions based on historical facts, filming techniques, and facial expressions were amazing in the movie. However, because there were lots of parts that audiences could not understand, I also craved a straight-forward message like what other movies give to audiences. Although it had some sad parts, this is one of the life-changing movies that I strongly recommend."

1.0,"Jan 26, 2021","""Parasite"" is as subtle as a sledgehammer. After a promising start, the film devolves into a simplistic, cliche-ridden, predictable mess, replete with the graphic violence that's de rigueur of contemporary films. The imagery, symbolism, and metaphors are laughably over-the-top, enough to make even a middle-schooler's eyes roll. It's about as sophisticated as a 3rd-rate TV show and not recommended to discerning viewers looking for substance."

2.0,"Jan 22, 2021",The story is quarky and the cinematography is simple but beautiful. But its just another stereotypical movie that depicts the rich as cruel and out of the touch. Over simplistic villians and seems more interested in advancing a narrative. The movie is worth a watch but way overrated for people not interested in movies that affirm a political worldview.
2.5,"Jan 20, 2021","Doing my best to keep this spoiler free, I would say that the film is watchable and it's probably worth seeing if only for social reasons as it does crop up here and there is most of my social circles that include movie fans. The plot centres on the misfortunes of a family and their ability to take advantage of their son getting his foot in the door of a lucrative opportunity. It's then a story of how things can escalate when you get into a situation you aren't in control of to begin with and the stakes keep raising. There are no glaring problems with the plot or characters, unless (I'm told) you happen to be familiar with South Korean culture. And the film does a decent job of making you care about most of the characters in it as it appropriately develops most of the characters in it so you can understand them as people. The problem comes in when you really start to pay attention to the characters and the decisions that they make. At it's core it poses the assumption that if you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. Which isn't unreasonable, until I add in that the mile would include driving over people, friends included, then it's a whole lot less reasonable and is only believable if we are talking about psychopaths. In the same way while the situation might initially seem understandable you are doomed if you ever ask yourself the question; but would you? If you and your family were in a desperate situation would you risk it all for more when the chance of you getting busted is actually pretty high? Probably not. If you were to seemingly succeed, would you repeat the process? Well, maybe since you were daft enough to try it again, but really, why would you? The film makes no effort to explain why they keep choosing to escalate the situation when they seem to move out of the most desperate situation immediately after acquiring the first opportunity, which was given to them legitimately. Instead they plough ahead taking risk after risk, then pretty soon the characters seem to forget how precarious their position is and make several obviously terrible decisions which act as a catalyst for further escalating situations. Culminating into an entirely avoidable situation. The biggest problem of all is that the means they use to go about setting up these further opportunities draw attention to how wicked they are as people and really sets you against them despite their own struggles. You then spend much of the film rooting for them to fail as much as you are hoping for everything to turn out alright, because although they were clearly desperate, it's equally apparent that they are bad people who don't hesitate to put other people in a situation as desperate as they have been in, so long as it's not them. I get the sense that this is supposed to be a duality within the film, but when one side completely overpowers the other, it doesn't work at all. The various bad circumstances that afflict the characters in no way comes even close to justifying their actions against others and just cements that fact that they are people who ultimately deserve to lose. That being said, the acting, which I have seen criticised, isn't bad. It's not Hollywood A-list but then placing that kind of expectation on them is unreasonable and they easily outperform some actors/actresses in Hollywood who have had repeated work in the industry. The music is perfectly crafted to enhance the experience and it's clear no expense nor effort was sparing in the sets. It's an experience that is only harmed by how obscene the choices the characters make and keep making. While you are watching you could become engrossed enough to forget these kinds of details and considerations, and if you can do that you will enjoy it. If you have an eye for the particulars however, Parasite is fundamentally no different from a B-list horror movie where the situation only happens because of continued awful decisions on the part of the main cast. I don't feel that this fundamentally a bad movie, despite how much I may have gone on about its flaws, but it's not something you are every likely to watch twice and I seriously doubt it's something that will be remembered as anything other than 'that foreign film that won best picture that one time'"

The ending is absolutely chaotic and movie just tries to be a drama that too with inexplicable events which do not add up at all. Trying to keep this spoiler free so will stop at that but i felt movie could have been much better with a decent end preferably on the similar theme of entire movie.

My favourite aspect of Parasite is how the film develops from an extremely entertaining light-hearted movie to more of a saddening look at poverty, to its eventual thrilling ending. It is a rollercoaster of moods, which may seem disjointed on paper, but they blend so well in Parasite that it works phenomenally. It's one of the best films of 2019 hands down, if not the best."

The look of the film is phenomenal and the way Joon-ho Bong shows the different classes is truly remarkable. The way the movie takes its time to show little things is great.

5.0,"Dec 18, 2020",What makes this movie truly compelling is that it has so much to say. It beautifully delves into the desperation of a lower class family before finding its footing in being a subtlety menacing tale of infiltration into a wealthier family's home through the manipulation of certain situations. On top of that it does a phenomenal job at looking into the psychological effect that money might have on people who don't have any. The film truly earns its marks when it evolves into a struggle between two parasitic families.

5.0,"Dec 14, 2020","Parasite is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Releasing on 7th February in the United Kingdom, Parasite has taken the world by storm, and for good reasons. This thriller/comedy is a marvel of modern cinema and undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade, with it already having deservingly won over 13 awards - even breaking Oscar history by taking home 4 awards in one night. Parasite (directed by Bong Joon-ho) follows the lives of the Kim family, showing the harsh realities of living in poverty and the slums of the city. The son, Ki-woo (portrayed by Choi Woo-shik), becomes the leader of the movement in his family to improve their life after being given a symbol of luck by a family friend. Ki-woo takes over as an English tutor for the Park family – a rich, powerful household who the Kims are able to leech off of in order to work their way up in society. The naïve head-of-household Mrs Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) is soon blindsided by the entirety of the Kim family, as their plans to remove the original workers of the household unfold successfully. Up until this point, Parasite appears to be quite a light-hearted film, however, things soon take a turn for the unexpected. Upon watch, it is clear why this film has so quickly been treasured by the majority of those that have seen it. Details as small as the film being separated by two specific acts are the reason it is so successful as a movie. It provides twists and turns that are almost impossible to predict for even the most keen-eyed viewers and film critics, even switching the entire genre of the movie when you least expect it. The transition between comedy and thriller is seamless and makes for extremely easy viewing, as two hours pass by without hesitation or a wanting for the film to hurry up at any point. A strong point of this movie is definitely the way the events are laid out. In most movies where action or horror takes place, we see this theme and set of sequences being dragged out across the entirety of the movie, often making it repetitive and occasionally boring after it having been shown already. Parasite however, successfully places the ‘action' throughout the film in specific places. These points of conflict or climax are skillfully placed to ensure that they don't become meaningless throughout the course of the film. Another point of discussion is the soundtrack of this cinematic wonder – more specifically the opening theme of the movie. Although the song is a simple piece on piano, it becomes very symbolic of the film as a whole, especially after watching it and then revisiting the song. The theme consists of an upwards ladder of notes, perhaps representing the climb the Kim's attempt to make in society through the Parks, with the Kims living in the slums and the Parks in uptown luxury. With a main image in this movie being stairs, it's no wonder why this song has been made similar to a climbing sound; ideas of climbing up the social ladder, with those high up in society being above and those lower are below. Despite being a simple piece, the emotions it can draw out of those that truly listen to it are powerful and I encourage all that have seen this movie to give this song another listen. Along with the main theme, Parasite's entire soundtrack is able to perfectly capture the tonal shifts of the film and add to the overall effect of some of its most powerful scenes. If you haven't seen Parasite already, I highly implore you to do so and hope that these common praises of the film encourage you further. This movie is one of the rare cases where a film is clearly going to be the best for years to come and be something to stick with you as a significant moment in cinematic history. Being the first foreign film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars (and deservedly so), Parasite truly is a masterpiece of modern cinema and should be what people take notes on when asking how to make cinematic history. A tragicomic that is impossible to forget, Parasite receives 5 stars – a movie I believe will remain a classic for decades to come."

1.5,"Dec 13, 2020",A disgusting piece of trash. It did give me insight into how worthless both the Oscars and Rotten Tomatoes are.
5.0,"Dec 12, 2020","I have no choice here but to add my voice to the resounding chorus of positive reviews for this movie. The sheer quantity and quality of plaudits that it's received made it nearly impossible to be anything but overrated, and yet it wasn't at all - it was exactly as good as they said it was, much to my delight. This is the best foreign-language movie that I have ever seen and will likely remain as such for a long time. Its depiction of class conflict and late-stage capitalism appeal to my own political senses to a very high degree. I would have liked the score to have played a bigger part in the movie as I'm never a big fan of minimalistic music, but in every other category this really blew me away. Kudos!"

5.0,"Dec 9, 2020","Absolutely gripping, edge of the seat watching. Subtitles worked well. Fabulous acting. Great movie 🎥 best this year."
5.0,"Dec 7, 2020","I became interested in the film after reading a friend's review. Looked, liked, original! I watched the South Korean film ""Parasites"", I want to admit that I don't often watch Korean films, but this film really interested me. The duration is a little more than two hours, but this dramatic Thriller flew by unnoticed, it was very interesting. The story itself was quite strong, philosophical and humorous. I must say that the problems that are raised in the picture turned out to be very modern and vital. It was interesting to watch, although the final was not so strong, it was a little disappointing, but it did not spoil the overall picture. In the process of viewing, only one thought was spinning in my head... they did not live richly, and it was not worth starting. People, of course, are shown not from the most pleasant side, real parasites! Why don't they understand that you need to learn, work, and achieve. How can one benefit from the benefits of others? Does this make you successful? How can you use someone else's kindness? Get right under your skin? How unpleasant it all is... You can talk about this endlessly, it is better to look at it yourself and draw your own conclusions. I must say that the film itself turned out to be very high-quality, the situation is correct, everything looks realistic. Well done creators! I definitely recommend the movie to watch, there is something to think about. A decent movie! What is this picture about? A very poor family lives in a basement, barely making ends meet. None of this family can get a normal job. But, one day, a friend of his son offers a part-time job in a decent house. A rich family needs an English tutor. This is a real gift of fate! But this was not enough... Okay, I won't write a spoiler and recommend this movie to everyone !"

5.0,"Dec 5, 2020","A movie that made me pog - BigChunk / It was a very interesting take on society as a whole, showing the juxtaposition of how the poor were treated when the flood happened while the rich were able to freely live their lives in luxury. A really good film, that also makes you question the title - 1412"

5.0,"Dec 4, 2020","Master filmmaker, Joon-Ho Bong accurately delivers the perfect combination for a horror-comedy in 'Parasite' and It really makes the audience, including me, say this movie is awesome. And that's what I'm saying the same thing to whoever is currently reading this review. Joon-Ho Bong's films never disappoint, including Parasite. That's a big fat yes from me."
5.0,"Nov 30, 2020","All aspect of life in a film. In the beginning it misguides you as if cheating life is possible. I like how they describes the haves and have nots. They are not necessarily good or bad. But the wealth or the absence of it shapes who we are in the society. We are the result of our circumstances mainly defined by wealth. Sad, uncomfortable, and true."

5.0,"Nov 27, 2020","Parasite is fantastic. It's clever. It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor. But the latter is so deftly weaved into the fabric of the story, you really don't think about it much until a fateful scene before the last act. It fully deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. If only for the peach fuzz fight scene."
4.5,"Nov 27, 2020","11/25/20 This film very much kept my attention. It certainly has an ""Us"" feel, with some unexpected and creepy themes. I admit, I did keep feeling like it was a Jordan Peele rip off, but it was still very good. FOr some, having to read subtitles the whole time is not ideal, but it didn't bother me too much. In fact, it may have kept me awake bc I had to pay really close attention the whole time. Very interesting plot, maybe a little bit much for those who are squeamish."

5.0,"Nov 20, 2020","PARASITE is a basically flawless dark suspense-comedy about class (think Snowpiercer but without the sci-fi, and funnier). So many twists and creative horrors. Begone, jump-scares, Joon-ho Bong has arrived. (side note: please don't watch it dubbed. That's just disrespectful). I'm definitely buying this on Criterion, which it definitely deserves."

1.0,"Nov 11, 2020","Before watching this I thought it was gonna be a load of crap and as usual I was spot on. Whilst it has some good scenes and good bits, overall it is a serious disappointment. I think because the film industry as a whole is mostly hype followed by serious failure, this might seem like a good film. Certainly it was different but to be honest I should have trusted my instincts and gave it a wide berth; next time I will."
2.5,"Nov 9, 2020","Quite average to me,don't know what the fuss is about"
5.0,"Nov 9, 2020",Parasite highlights as much about the talent of its creators as it does about society and the observed differences between rich and poor. The architectural splendor of the Parker home and the greasy confines of The Kim basement are presented immaculately. The story intensifies beautifully and the feeling of impending chaos is gripping. It's as chilling as it is warm. As real as it is imaginative. This movie deserves its widespread acclaim.
3.0,"Nov 8, 2020",It was overrated. The story was kinda predictable and the twist was unnecessary
5.0,"Nov 7, 2020","Easily the best movie of 2019, and perhaps the decade. A true film masterpiece. It's a real surprise how the film unfolds, with numerous layers revealing shocking, unpredictable and thrilling twists and ends. All this whilst making a political statement about the ongoing problem of capitalism rooting in our society."

4.0,"Nov 1, 2020","Despite hearing about this from day dot, I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it's title, director and subsequent success. Boy am I glad, because it's quite the ride! No doubt about it, 'Parasite' is a high quality film. It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts. The cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet. Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun. I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film. From the cinematography, to the dialogue, to the locations, to the humour. You name it, this produces it on an impressive level. Not that I need to say this, given I'm seemingly one of the last few who hadn't, but you must watch this!"

As with this ""And as a kind of chaotic both external and internal bloody class warfare ensues. Essentially creating for the amusement of the giddy bourgeois popcorn audience - both consumers and critics - a cinematic 21st century gladiator spree. Director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Okja) presents a condescending, pessimistic portrayal of human nature, bereft of class consciousness or ideology. And a working class whose sole motivation is to go to extremes, or aspiring to do so, to replace when not feeding off the economic class exploiting them - and in the process eliminating any potential workingclass competitors as well."" https://wbairadiowomen.blogspot.com/2019/10/parasite-deplorables-south-korea-style.html"

5.0,"Oct 4, 2020","Deserved every award it won and much more. This high paced thriller is original, beautifully shot, entertaining and surprising at every moment. Gone girl is the closest thriller that comes to mind over the past decade, but it is still unparalleled to Parasite."
5.0,"Oct 1, 2020",Parasite uses its premise to deliver rich social commentary along with clever and subtle metaphors to create a truly fantastic movie showing the pros and cons of an extreme lifestyle. This brilliantly crafted film has cemented its director Bong Joon-Ho as a filmmaking legend.

1.5,"Sep 22, 2020","Fell apart as soon as the son started lying about perfectly competent sister, dad, and mom to the rich couple. Who deserved to get SIKED by these THIEVES. The sister was actually good at art. The dad was actually a good driver. The mom was good at housework. You think these people couldn't make their lives better on merit, or couldn't get hired by that family? Sure, the rich couple were dimwit *ssholes, but so were the ""good"" family. Could've been a real movie if the characters weren't caricatures. But that wouldn't bring in the money."

5.0,"Sep 8, 2020","This is one of the best directed films of all time. This film shows hollywood is dying, and that these foreign and independent companys are original. This film builds tension so good, it also has some of the most disturbing film editing in recent years. the main setting has very unique. The character arcs are very diffrent and original than most films."
4.5,"Sep 8, 2020","This movie is going to catch your attention and get your mind into it, it is not a hard movie to understand, but it is a hard movie to digest. The sequence of this movie is perfectly well made and this film combine all movie genders including a black humor always, this film will make you laugh, cry, feel fear and anxiety, if you watch this film prepare yourself to feel a roller coaster of emotions experience, I'm sure you are going to love it! This movie reflects the consumerism, capitalism and social inequality that exist in our world, and how every one needs to become a parasite being selfish, care less and killing everything around us just to cover our on benefits and to survive. Also, this movie represents and show the fakeness of the society and how we are used to build and alternative alter ego to be part of it. This movie its one of the best movies of 2019, this movie has been in six nominations and won four Oscars in 2020. I highly recommend you to watch it and live a unique and amazing experience through it."
4.5,"Sep 8, 2020","I came in with much skepticism due to all the hype, but damn this was an incredible movie. I must give my first praise to the cast. They did an incredible job in making every character feel so real. Everyone worked so well together, that they almost convinced me that they were real people. The plot and the progression was excellently executed. Many props to the director. He strung together an incredibly well made film. I loved all the juxtapositions between the families, and I enjoyed the subtle imagery (well sometimes not so subtle). While the plot is a bit absurd, Bong Joon-ho suspends my disbelief. Once again props to him. Every scene is well crafted and serves a meaningful purpose to the story, and all the play with lighting really aids it. The only reason I took off half a star is due to the final act of the film. It is forced fed to us, unlike the rest of them film which everything is dynamic. I did enjoy the bleak message of the ending. Overall, one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend."

5.0,"Sep 3, 2020","Parasite has illustrated the big gap between two social classes in a smart, beautiful and dramatic way, the cinematography and the camera movement made the scenes very engaged, highly recommended and it deserves to win the best picture."
1.5,"Sep 2, 2020","I'm not part of the crowd that adores this film. I felt it was overrated. And one of those films where the idea of watching a bunch of unlikeable, fairly unredeemable, immoral people is somehow considered enjoyable just because...it's shocking? What? 18 year olds in art college make ""shocking films"" just because there is this weird idea in our creative culture that says if you do something ""shocking"" JUST to shock, you are valuable and entertaining. I don't agree. There has to be more substance behind it, rather than just that 18-year-old art student vibe of ""look what I'm doing! Aren't I SHOCKING YOU?!"" I feel like I see through it and a lot of people don't. Oh well. Also, the idea that this is intelligent commentary is misleading. The idea that rich are evil and dumb by nature of being rich, and that poor people are simultaneously superior yet completely immoral, villianous heathens is just outdated and weird. It's not a movie about an empathetic poor family who end up in a gray area and do horrible things that are also kind of justifiable. It's just random shock value with unsympathetic characters that people ate up even though it didn't make any sense. I mean... sure, if you just want to make a SLASHER film, then by all means, do it. But if I don't care about the characters that I'm supposed to, or, you don't even want me to care about the characters, but then expect me to sit through their lives and then call it art... not going to happen. I need emotional investment or at least have the honesty to admit it's just a wild slasher movie. I read an article that South Korea is actually economically doing really well and that this is a misleading representation, anyway. So, there goes the revolutionary commentary out the window. There are so many better foreign films out there. So many better films that comment on wealth inequality or classism."

4.0,"Aug 31, 2020","Pretty good movie by boon jong ho a really good director most notable to me snow piercer. So when I heard this same guy was making Oscar history I had to check out his movie. So I saw it and it's not that special, yes it does show how bad the lower class is in South Korea but I've seen so many movies that do the exact same thing. Based off the title I thought their would be some crazy epidemic like boon jong hos other movie the host but nope . Just social commentary calling the parasite s poor people which is really clever. This movie is pretty clever in that way and entertaining at times. To get to the good part of the movie it took a good 25 30 minutes. What I mean is the good part is when Kevin is at the house. The acting is amazing. I've never seen a foreign movie to make me interested in the acting. Cause reading subtitles is kinda rough, I know first world problems but still. I know people that will agree with me. Anyway it may seem that I'm hating on this movie but it's very entertaining but would I ever see this movie again, probably not. Maybe if my friend wants to see it for a first time but besides that I'll just stick to the TV show. Hopefully it's better."

Even though it was described to me as a ""thriller,"" it is not scary, there are no ghosts, and the whole movie is worth watching just for the montage where they're setting up the housekeeper. 10 stars for hilarity & execution, and almost no boring bits in the entire movie. Minus 5 stars for killing off the best character, and minus another half a star for the random sex scene the rich people have while staring at their child outside in a tent."

5.0,"Aug 26, 2020",Parasite is a film that not only lives up to the hype but far surpasses it due to the expert craftmanship from Bong Joon-ho. The script is near perfect with impactful and hilarious dialogue sprinkled with intense moments and shocking twists. Foreign films don't quite get this much mass appeal and that is solely because of the films strength to present a universal theme is a relatable but Shakespearean tragedy.

Not quite a heist, not quite a thriller, whatever intelligence was present at the beginning got shoved for a strange climax and 30 minute long resolution? Pass and save yourself the 2 hours."
3.5,"Aug 2, 2020","Parasite should have been shortened before its releasing, but despite the lack of pertinence felt during some scenes it has some great gripping moments. Its outstanding cast also helped to turn an interesting premise into a whole different refreshing story. The cinematography is undeniably amazing and the director did a great job gathering all the pieces to construct something new."

4.5,"Jul 31, 2020",An impressively constructed South Korean film. The lives of the rich and poor become entangled leading to disaster outs consequences. Just a superbly filmed story that you can't help but engage with.
4.5,"Jul 31, 2020","What started out as a more neutral, lighthearted seeming story, soon began to exponentially increase in the thriller category. Top marks for cinematography, as well as the underlying dark and relatable theme shown throughout the movie. Parasite definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it."
5.0,"Jul 31, 2020","Parasite is that kinda film which you would love to feel through in your eyes.Perfect screenplay took this film to another level . Poverty can somehow beats up the world .But director does't shows it in a dramatic way, over hilloriously or by doing melo dramas. That's the spirit. Happy to watch it and i really admire this film to my heart."

Parasite is over all an Interesting premise and entertaining story, while well written and decent overall production, sound editing was bad and for what it was the story moved to slowly and is frankly (while still interesting) absurd..... And only gets more for lack of a better word wacky as it goes along. The movie could have been an hour shorter and still been the same or better. Is it good? Yes But I believe it gained far to much credit for what it was this is a mediocre film getting the best picture Oscar just because weird is in."

It didn't have any ""slow parts"" where my mind wanted to wander or check my phone, etc. Fantastic acting, well written and directed...a great movie. And that should be saying something, as I don't typically like foreign language films."
5.0,"Jul 30, 2020","Parasite is a splendid dark comedy/drama. Some people need heavy rain to wash their sins away but this family of characters seem to drown in their own decisions. The story line is funny, dark, violent, intelligent, miraculous yet downright impossible. Parasite delivers a broad spectrum of theater. It's like a South Korean modern day twist on some vintage Shakespeare, 'deuce ex machina' included for the hardcore fans of plot twisting. Great ensemble, stunning visual sets, multi-layered plot...what more can you ask for? If all the characters are just trying to get by and do the right thing to survive, then how can you get a script to work so well with so much failure? Parasite uses multiple old-school movie/theater/writing tactics in a different, perhaps foreign perspective and the complete package comes off as fresh and original in a way that Director/Writer/Producer Bong Jung Ho rightly deserves credit for. When a film from Korea takes home 4 Oscars, you should think about watching foreign cinema if you already have not."
3.0,"Jul 28, 2020","A film that forces viewers to ask the question, whom is a parasite to whom? With every scene further proving that we might not ever get a right answer, it just depends what lens we see things through.

0.5,"Jul 24, 2020","Unenjoyable and offensive. What is the ""subtext"" on class meant to be...? That poor people are untrustworthy, unscrupulous grifters and murderers? That the class 'war' can never be settled? There's not a single compelling character in this whole steaming heap of trash- everyone is unreachable and/or detestable. Maybe that is the point? I have a legitimate hard time not judging people who liked this movie. You have to enjoy violence, and I don't mean the arcade stormtrooper-zapping kind. I mean you have to enjoy watching meaningless, graphic, up-close-and-personal violence. No, no, don't be all ""but it has mmeeaaaning! it's about class! it's sophisticated!"" no its not, that's a bunch of malarkey. If someone gave this unpleasant garbage 5 stars.. I am forced to wonder what would their reaction to other things be? If they went to an ophthalmologist who stabbed their eyes out instead of giving them a new prescription, would they review them as follows: ""Dr. soandso thinks outside of the box, a compelling experience, I couldn't look away, wow!"" Because that's what all these reviews look like to me. I don't know what disease of the mind you all have, but this movie is a solid minus 100 stars. It is not only unpleasant to watch, but the ""food for thought"" included is offensive garbage. Quit feeling all sophisticated because you watched a movie where class is a theme. This is just a misery-party, a everyone-sucks buffet. It's not sophisticated. It's a slow burn tension thriller wearing a fancy dress. I skimmed some of those glowing critic reviews. They pay lip service to the idea that it's about the ""analysis of the disparities between social classes"".. but any fruits to that analysis? No, all the critics move on swiftly from that and prattle on about the tension and the violence and the ""dropping the hammer"" on the audience. Because there's no clever commentary here, the class thing is just a setting."
4.5,"Jul 23, 2020","Parasite follows the poor Kim family who score jobs with the wealthy Park family, by impersonating as fully-qualified professionals to get even. However, things turn for the worse when the former housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) and her husband Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon) from downstairs threaten to tell the Parks of their exploitive soliciting, resulting in the Kims sneaking out of the Park house, them losing their home due to a rainstorm, them relocating to a homeless shelter, several family members murdered in a birthday party, Geun-sae fleeing scot free, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) the patriarch taking shelter in the Park's basement, and Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the son, dreaming of buying the same upscale house. Putting aside the Oscar's racial overcompensation and its inception as the first foreign language to win Best Picture, this is without a doubt one of the funniest and most clever films I have seen in the past five years. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the ‘upstairs/downstairs' genre, especially because, aside from the period costumes, I find these shows or movies sluggish and elitist. However, what makes Parasite stand out is that it plays to the inner sadist in both societal merits, allowing for some outlandishly hilarious character-based humor. The Kims are the low-income optimists who dream of moving to an elevation bigger than themselves and the Parks are the naive, money-grabbing, spoiled snobs who rob from the poor and mock their ‘old basement smell'. The movie also combines said humor with the more intense gritty Sam Peckinpah style violence and thought-provoking drama, to a point where the quality of writing goes into Coen Brothers territory. But those moments like the murders at Park Da-song's (Jung Hyeon-jun) party don't shy away from the film's theme of social rivalry and betrayal. So, as far as ‘upstairs/downstairs' movies are concerned, Parasite is probably my favorite. (4 ⅕ Peach Skin Shavings out of 5)"
4.0,"Jul 22, 2020","About half an hour too long with the odd bit dragging but overall, a film that builds momentum and has you on the edge of your seat by the end. Carries a powerful message on wealth and equality."
5.0,"Jul 21, 2020","Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced, and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it. Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated."

1.5,"Jul 20, 2020","I just have to grade a movie is by how many times I would want to watch it over and over. I wouldn't want to watch the movie Parasite again; like Precious. It was worth 1 watching, but that one time is enough for life. I been to Korea multiple times, I've never seen anybody even in the poorest of areas, which are not many, live that poor. On top of it the idea that this tutor could get every single one of his family members to come and work for the wealthy family was so absurdly ridiculous...! It wasn't even believable for second! And that's what really bothered me from the point he got his mother in all the way towards the end. what also was not believable is when the father went and killed the rich father. As a viewer you were constantly being forced to suspend your ability to think logically realistically to the tune of none of it was believable after a while. There were some heart warming moments, sure. But they were soon followed by unrealistic story segments."
4.5,"Jul 20, 2020","Parasite reminded me of Haneke's Funny Games, Chabrol's La Ceremonie, Peele's Get Out and others. A beautifully controlled black black comedy with a savage and violent climax, it's very well acted and operates on several levels - satirising class, manners, the way plans invariably go wrong. The camera glides, the music soothes, the blood flows and the sewage rises. Unusual and intelligent."
5.0,"Jul 20, 2020","Watched this movie, and loved it so much I immediately watched it again. Despite it being my second viewing, I still laughed at jokes I'd heard before, and was on the edge of my seat during scenes I knew the outcome of. Film of the decade."
4.5,"Jul 20, 2020","‘Parasite's' opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road, sets the visual language of the film firmly, right at the onset. There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film. Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a clumisly heaped plate of food from a local kitchen. Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor ""slavering"" over her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo given what we know and learn about him is a valid question. The young man changes his name to Kevin and begins tutoring Park Da-hye , who immediately falls for him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister ""Jessica"" to enter the picture. Before long, mom and dad are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then everything changes."

2.5,"Jul 17, 2020","To begin with I'm not a fan of Bong Joon-ho. I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second. I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory. So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to. A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. To quote Calvino: ""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars."""

Nas relações entre classes, os mais desfavorecidos são muito mais prejudicados. No longa, os ricos não são responsáveis pelo que decorre da chuva, mas sim somente por não saberem de seus malefícios à outros. E se mostra bastante preocupado em retratar a classe c como vermes rastejantes aproveitadores e homicidas. Enquanto que o grande pecado dos ricos é o de não se preocuparem com os necessitados, quando sabemos que eles fazem bem mais do que isso. Teria sido uma ótima experiencia para mim, se não estivesse me sentindo bastante agredido pela obvia alegoria. Mas quando será que vimos isso antes na historia do cinema? Tecnicamente, o filme é impecável. Além de tentar justificar uma visão desavergonhadamente elitista. Não à toa recebeu a estatueta de melhor filme do ano, nos Estado Unidos."

A story basically of criminal scamming made comedy, The acting, directing, script, are all up to par, but again I'm not really sure about a birdie or hole in one in terms of amazing, or leaving me with a feeling of watching it over and over again. In fact, for myself, how I know I really love a movie is when I watch it over and over. It is unlikely I will watch this movie again. The ending was somewhat bewildering, though the message overall appears clear as it relates to pursuing what you think is the good life, only to find that you can easily ruin it. It's also of course a very wrong lesson in using criminal deception to take advantage of innocent people, especially when it leads to murder.

No translation, no long fancy letters that somewhat jump the shark, no explanation from Ki-taek.

I am not sure what the director was aiming for, the plot is too far-fetched for the film to be taken as a serious social statement. It plodded along and was obvious where it was going for the first half - and, it was only saved by a few plot surprises in the second. The sex scene was ‘tick the box' (because that is what you do when three actors are hiding under the coffee table in the living room). None of the characters are likeable or engaging - other than, perhaps, the father. The film would have been so much better if had been made as a comedy - there could have been laughs a plenty.

4.0,"Jun 6, 2020","Is the illusion of watching a stage drama because the giant glass in the living room of the Pak family is treated as another visual screen in the movie? Camerawork, which captures moving characters in a house at a distance, emphasizes the objectivity of the viewer to the drama that occurs in a large box-like space in a building. However, the person's settings are so well organized that each person can face internal conflicts as the story progresses. Therefore, the objectivity and subjectivity are well balanced, and it is not difficult to draw the audience into the movie. The intersection of acting and casting talent is so powerful. Human contradictions, dignity, and many other things that connect people to each other, what is the thing, what is the discomfort you feel when you say you did it by yourself, using your own abilities. Ultimately we are only human in our relationships. It's a tragic sentiment of not being able to live without comparing yourself to others. It could be described as a film that preaches the courage and responsibility to take on one's own life."

3.0,"Jun 6, 2020","This movie has become overrated and I believe it only won Best Picture to further promote left-leaning political ideologue. It's not a bad movie, but I just don't see this being remembered. There is only one single moment in the film where a light of truth and inspiration spark to give you some feeling of hope in a realistic grounded sense.(I won't spoil this scene but it has something to do with a rock and a homeless shelter). But the majority of the film isn't like that. The characters feel disingenuous even when they're not ""pretending"", except for maybe the mother who has a more realistic tone to her through out the movie. Despite that what bothers me about this film is that I don't see what anyone can take away from this other than a narrative that rich people are bad and naive and poor people are good and real. If that's the message that it gives then it has done more harm than good. Like I said it's not a bad film but the amount of praise it receives I feel is exaggerated. But to each his own.

2.0,"May 31, 2020",I do not get the universal acclaim for this film. It is deeply disturbing but completely unpleasant. There are few if any characters to care about so it was hard to invest in the story. The acting was its lone strong point.
5.0,"May 31, 2020","The director created one of the best cult movies in the 20th century. From the second 10 it catches you, full of excitement from start to finish. I love everything, just made history."
4.5,"May 31, 2020",A very good movie that kept me engaged the entire time.
3.5,"May 30, 2020","A good film by my measures (though not superb), esp. from the South-Korean cinema. It deals with and depicts a part of the South-Korean society that I'd never seen before. It's a dark satire, and recommended as an outstanding film from the East Asian region."
1.5,"May 30, 2020","I am shocked at the rating. It was somewhat negative, not particularly clever or endearing. Statement on class struggle from point of view of jealousy and envy rather that achievement. Can see why it would appeal to the patronising academy as a masterpiece. Everyone remained in their place."

5.0,"May 29, 2020","This is a film from South Korea and it is the first non-English film to win the Best Picture Oscar. And what a brilliant film it is. This is storytelling at its finest, with an engrossing marriage of script, cinematography, acting and detail. Director Bong Joon-ho weaves a tale that vacillates between drama and black comedy flawlessly. And just when you get comfortable with this vacillation, he throws in an unexpected twist which brilliantly turns the movie into a suspenseful thriller. As if that weren't captivating enough, the entire film is a satire on societal classes that hammers down hard and heavy. There are 10 main characters, and the actors that inhabit them are all impressive. However, I would be remiss not to highlight Kang-ho Song as the patriarch of the Kim family. His ability to convey emotions, and switch between them in seconds, without uttering a word was inspired. He could have you chuckling and then gut wrenched with just the slightest of movement and expression. He was the blue diamond among a cast of rubies and emeralds. The story revolves around the Kim family and the Park family. The Kims are a family of little means who are not above con work to obtain an income. The Parks are an affluent family who breeze through the world of social elitism rather obliviously. The Kim family son cons his way into a job tutoring the Park family daughter. Manipulating Mrs. Park, eventually each member of the Kim family ends up working for the Parks, though the Parks are unaware that any of the Kims are actually related. The deception of how each Kim obtains a position in the Park home is outrageously funny. Once they are all employed however, things take a turn in a fantastic ""what the hell?"" moment! To provide more details would be a disservice for anyone who decides to view the film. In the end, which family is the parasite remains uncertain. Is it the Kims living off the wealth of the Parks or is it the Parks living off the hard work of the Kims? The movie is quite clear though as it closes on its heartbreaking ending, that the wide gap of wealth disparity is the new norm and the upward mobility of the working class is quite clearly the shadow of a bygone era. No doubt this is one reason the movie resonated so well to audiences worldwide."

5.0,"May 26, 2020","Wow. This film is worthy of all of its accolades and then some. It is incredibly well-written, directed, and acted. Bong Joon Ho has crafted this movie masterfully. It is one of those movies that keeps you guessing what will happen next every scene and occasionally throws you a major curveball, but not one that is entirely unexpected. Each character is fleshed out really well and is interesting to watch. The social undertones add an extra layer of depth that makes the film resonate on a deeper level with its viewers. It is well paced and does not waste any time going from point to point. The dialogue is so key in this film and each line seemingly has a deeper meaning or connects to a later plot point. This movie will make you laugh, cry, cringe, and everything in between. This is a film that is enjoyable and can easily be viewed more than once, which it should be viewed more than once. I really cannot find anything to knock on this film. I found it very interesting and entertaining on top of being very well crafted. Overall, I give this movie a 10/10."

5.0,"May 24, 2020","So I just saw the heavily hyped up movie among my filmmaker friends and yeah it was pretty good and even better than I expected, especially in the Third act which you know I wouldn't dare spoil. The movie from a technical aspect was visual splendor to the Eyes 👀 from color grading to make each setting distinct from the other whether it's the dark gritty streets or the bright color rich garden of the suburbs. All this is complemented by the cinematography and well-placed camera shots and proper use of blocking. The director Bong Joon-ho has always done ✅ a great job with his passion for filmmaking with previous works like The Host, Snowpiercer and Okja and the same level quality's on full display here with great performances across the board from Cho Yeo-Jeong, Park So-dam, Lee Jeong-Eun, Jeong Ji-so, Choi Woo-Shik, Lee Sun-Kyun, and Jang Hye-jin. This was one of those heavily hyped films 🎞 that thankfully 😅 lived up to it had a great time and I give it a 9.5/10"

The way you are pulled into the story and the lives of the characters while you are given the chance to enjoy the symbolism and the references to other genres beyond the obvious mixure of comedy and drama is so sophysticated! I would have rated it with 5 stars if the director had decided to make it a few minutes minutes shorter (in my opinion, the last 4-5 minutes of the film were not necessary)"

3.0,"May 22, 2020","Finally got to see what all the hoopla was about. In no way, shape, or form is this a masterpiece as I’ve heard it described. I think if it was an American movie it wouldn’t have garnished so much praise, nor nominations. With that said, as a South Korean film entering into the realm of more than just a horror film, which they do so well, it is a worthwhile first entry. I agree with most in that none of the characters were particularly likable, nor the last 1/4 of the film as good as the first two. The best part for me coincidentally was the last two minutes."
4.0,"May 22, 2020","I lived in Korea for many years and so I saw this movie in Korean theatres. It was a good movie and it reminded me a lot of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" and the battle between the Eloi and Morlocks (the rich/higher class and the poor/lower class). I don't think the director really intended this, but it was a good, modern take of this idea."
4.5,"May 22, 2020","It comes off as a sad story about a struggling family in South Korea. Though it starts off slow, you begin to realize they don't feel sorry for themselves at all. With Parasite being the most appropriate title to the movie, their brilliant schemes keep them happy only for a while, until reality comes crashing in. It's a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last moment. Highly recommend."

4.5,"May 21, 2020","""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned. Look around you. Did you think these people made a plan to sleep in the sports hall with you? But here we are now, sleeping together on the floor. So, there's no need for a plan. You can't go wrong with no plans. We don't need to make a plan for anything. It doesn't matter what will happen next. Even if the country gets destroyed or sold out, nobody cares. Got it?"" 🍑 Standing head and shoulders above its awards season competition in spite of an obvious language barrier, Gisaengchung is the smartest film about class warfare for some time, and by and large the best of 2019. A brilliantly brutal masterclass in editing, pacing, writing and everything in between, acclaimed director and now household name Bong Joon-ho does for stairs in this ""pitch-black modern fairytale"" what he did for trains in 2013's Snowpiercer, and follows in Hitchcock's footsteps by taking the movie medium to a higher level. Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly. As close to cinematic poetry as achieved in the 2010s, this sardonic social satire defies genre, clichés and storytelling conventions for surprising narrative turns, gasp-inducing horror and hilarious chamber piece exchanges, all working in service of a filmgoing experience like no other released in many years. Best watched with no prior knowledge of what to expect, yet still encourages and greatly rewards repeat viewings, show this stunning feature to someone you care about, and prepare to have them left speechless by ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains"". 9/10 nuclear text messages."

5.0,"May 21, 2020","I have watched this movie 3 times. However, I am not saying that is my limit. I will watch it another time soon. And once more, I will cry tears of middle class sorrow. The director's eye for detail in every scene makes this film feel like the Mona Lisa of the cinematic universe. Every time you rewatch, there is something new awaiting to be seen in the light. The many problems in the families can easily open the eyes of the ignorant world and allow everyone to notice the true divide of society. Not everyone has a creepy married man in their basement, but any viewer can certainly understand the underlying tensions throughout the movie. Letting the audience be welcomed into the lives of the poor family makes it easier to sympathize when (OOPSIE DOOPSIE SPOILER HERE) comes into play. I give this movie CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP. I relate the cashier man. I too hate my wife and children."
5.0,"May 20, 2020","Parasite is a 2019 South Korean satirical tragedy heist horror thriller dramedy film written and directed by Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. It stars Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun. The film follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. I'm gonna say the m-word: masterpiece. Say it with me. MASTERPIECE! How does such a prestigious film critic, such as I, convey when a film is unexpected, unpredictable, and above all else, brilliant in ways that feel like I just showed you an episode of Rick & Morty, and therefore your 3rd eye has transcended the laws of basic human anatomy, and opened. Do you think I'm the ""towering-inferno-of-physical-and-mental-perfection"" that cried masterpiece? I'll probably do my best to convince (coerce) you that Parasite truly is a masterpiece. Just trust me on this one, please. Bong has made several films about class, including Snowpiercer and Okja, but Parasite may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define our modern-day world. It's a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satirical comedy of manners that showcases a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics. But then, Bong takes a hard right turn at exactly the middle of the film that asks us what we're watching and practically warns us that there will be blood. Can the poor really just step into the world of the rich? The second half of the film is one of the most daring things I've seen in years storywise. The film constantly threatens to come apart; to take one convoluted turn too many in ways that sink the project, but Bong holds it all together, and the result is absolutely breathtaking to behold. Kim Ki-woo and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some quick cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with, as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor to also fall in love with her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo is pretty much the only flaw that I can find in the film. Then again I don't have 20/20 vision, so I might need the help of Dora the Explorer. Our hero changes his name to ""Kevin"" and begins tutoring Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), who immediately falls in love with him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister ""Jessica"" to enter the picture. Before long, mommy and daddy are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, changes. The screenplay for the film has rightfully gotten a lot of attention as it's one of those clever twisting and turning tales for which the screenwriter gets the most credit (Bong and Han Jin-won, in this case), but this is very much an exercise in visual storytelling that reaffirms Bong as a master. Working with the incredible cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and an A-list design team, Bong's film is captivating with every single composition. The clean, empty spaces of the Park home contrasted against the tight quarters of the Kim home isn't just symbolic, it's visually stimulating without ever calling full attention to itself. And there's a reason the Kim apartment is halfway underground; they're caught between worlds, stuck in the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The film is marvelously entertaining in terms of its story, but there's also so much going on underneath about how the rich use the poor to survive in many ways. Suffice to say, the wealthy in any country survive on the labor of the poor, whether it's the housekeepers, tutors, and drivers they employ, or something much darker. Kim's family will be reminded of that chasm and the cruelty of injustice in ways you couldn't possibly predict. The social commentary of the film inevitably leads to chaos, but it never feels like a teacher teaching you something. It's somehow, and I'm still not even really sure how, both joyful and depressing at the same time. Stick with me here. The film is so perfectly calibrated that there's joy to be had in just experiencing every confident frame of it, but then that's tempered by thinking about what Bong is unpacking here and saying about the society that we live in, especially with the perfect, absolutely haunting final scenes. It's a conversation starter in ways we only get a few times a year, and a further reminder that Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best filmmakers working today. Parasite is a masterpiece. Damnit. I tried to avoid it. This time it's true."
5.0,"May 20, 2020",The best movie I've ever seen!
5.0,"May 20, 2020","Parasite was written and directed by Bong Joon-Ho and it's about a low class family tricking a high class family into letting them in their house. This movie is literally flawless. The story is incredible, the way it is told is impeccable, the acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the score is perfect, it has it all. It starts as a really funny mix between a drama and a comedy but it suddenly turns into a very dark themed movie and even violent towards the end. This movie is a masterpiece, I genuinely stared at the screen after it ended just to process what just happened before my eyes. This is easily Bong Joon-Ho's best movie yet, and one of the best movies of the last decade, for sure. Parasite is an absolute must see."
3.5,"May 20, 2020",Overrated but still a good movie.
5.0,"May 20, 2020","Para mí de las mejores películas de la historia. Por dónde empezar… esta película hace todo bien, una dirección que Bong Joon Ho ha ido puliendo a lo largo de su carrera, una fotografía hermosa, un guión perfecto y actuaciones impecables de todo el reparto. Está historia habla, de una forma llena de simbolismos, de la sociedad. En sí de las clases sociales, pero lo hacen de una forma tan artística, usando el concepto del edificio. Osea yendo desde lo más bajo (El sótano) hasta lo más alto (El Penthouse). Me sorprende cómo de este tema, Bong Joon Ho puede hacer una historia llena de tensión, tensión que no sentía hace mucho en una película. Realmente es una historia que aunque se ambiente en Corea, cada persona de todo el mundo se puede identificar, claro en especial latinoamérica. Simplemente otra obra de arte del cine."

5.0,"May 19, 2020",Parasite from director Bong Joon-ho is a very symbolic movie on a lot of different levels. There are many messages throughout Parasite that are harsh but true especially the divide between the rich and the poor. The set design and acting work together to create beautiful suspense that had me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I love that Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture. Please don't let the subtitles discourage you from watching Parasite because you don't want to miss Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece.
4.0,"May 19, 2020","""We all live in the same country... called capitalism."""
2.0,"May 18, 2020","I am deeply disappointed. I didn't see the movie at the time of the release, only after it swept the Oscars. I don't mean that the film is bad, but I found it extremely overrated. The first part is really fun and does the job of introducing the situation, and making the audience become attached to characters, so it's almost impossible for you to have a favorite character or be ""supporting"" on the one hand. However, this act becomes very slow and long, to the point of getting tiring at some point. In the second act the film gains breath. The plot's various turning points (some surprising, others completely predictable) make the film's rhythm leave the doldrums of the first act for something intense, but without becoming rushed. The big problem here is that the atmosphere of the film is drastically changed, which for the most part is seen as a serious mistake, seems to have gone ""unnoticed"" by most critics. I think it is good that the story takes goes that the audience was not waiting, but the film must be faithful with the tone that he himself established. But nothing is as problematic in this film as its conclusion. Again the film drastically changes its tone (different from the previous two) and moves on to an appalling appeal. By then the film had already had some very questionable script facilitations, but nothing compared to what happens at the end. Many characters take completely unreasonable actions in an attempt to make an impressive and surprising ending. However, what I saw were completely different characters from the ones the film had presented, forcing to try to impress the audience. If you still like any characters at this point, I think you should look for a psychological one. Parasite tries to be a comedy, a drama and a thriller. Notice that I didn't say a dramatic comedy or a comic thriller. There is no harmony between the different genres, so that one swallows the other as the plot goes on. The result of this is that the film does not work like any of them."
5.0,"May 18, 2020",Absolute must watch. One of my favorites ever.
